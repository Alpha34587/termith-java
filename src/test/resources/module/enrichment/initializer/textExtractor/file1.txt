Abstract
To elucidate the contribution of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) to `echo' processing, this study documents the
responses of AVCN neurons to simulated echoes and compares them to those of auditory nerve (AN) fibers. Single unit discharges
were recorded from 121 units in the AVCN of 21 unanesthetized decerebrate cats in response to click pairs with inter-click intervals
ranging from 1 to 32 ms between 45 and 105 dB SPL re 20 WPa. Units were classified according to the post-stimulus time histogram
(PSTH) and excitatory-inhibitory response area (EI-area) schemes. Based on their spontaneous rates (SR), units were subdivided
into low- ( 6 20 spikes/s) and high- ( s 20 spikes/s) SR groups. A majority of the units exhibited second-click responses whose
recovery time courses were similar to those of AN fibers. These units included primary-like, chopper and onset units in the PSTH
scheme and Types I, I/III and III units in the EI-area scheme. A minority of the units exhibited responses that were distinct from
those of AN fibers, in that they had second-click response recovery times that were either markedly reduced or prolonged. This
group of units included those with primary-like, chopper and onset PSTHs and Type I/III and III EI-areas. No significant difference
was found in the second-click response among various PSTH or EI-area types. High-SR AVCN units exhibited a decrease in the
second-click response with increasing level. In contrast, low-SR AVCN units showed little level-dependent change in the second-click
responses. This SR-based difference was similar to that previously found among AN fibers. The present results suggest that,
although a majority of AVCN units exhibit similar time courses of second-click response recovery to those of AN fibers, there do
exist mechanisms in the cochlear nucleus that can substantially alter this representation. Furthermore, the difference between the
second-click response recovery functions of low- and high-SR AVCN units and the consistency of this finding between AVCN and
AN suggest that SR represents an important dimension for signal representation in the AVCN neurons. z 1998 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
In a reverberant environment, such as a lecture hall,
an acoustic signal originating from one location is typically followed by its echoes that arrive at the ears from
multiple directions. Nevertheless, a listener can correctly perceive a single auditory image and its correct
direction. This phenomenon of the ¢rst wavefront taking precedence over later-arriving wavefronts has been
referred to as the `law of the ¢rst wavefront' or `prece* Corresponding author. Tel.: +1 (860) 679-3690;

dence e¡ect' (Wallach et al., 1949 ; Haas, 1951; Von
Bekesy, 1960 ; Blauert, 1997). To gain an understanding
of the mechanisms involved in auditory processing of
the echoes, it would be useful to study this phenomenon
across multiple structures within the ascending auditory
pathway.
We recently reported on echo processing features of
the auditory nerve (AN) ¢bers in the unanesthetized
decerebrate cat (Parham et al., 1996). A main ¢nding
was that the recovery of the response to the trailing
click of a click pair among AN ¢bers not only depended on stimulus parameters (i.e., interclick interval
and click level) but also on ¢ber spontaneous rate (SR).

High-SR ¢bers exhibited longer recovery times than
their low-SR counterparts.
The cochlear nucleus (CN) serves as the obligatory
termination site of AN ¢bers. Anatomically, it can be
subdivided into three main divisions : the anterior and
posterior ventral cochlear nuclei (AVCN and PVCN,
respectively) and the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN).
Each subdivision is composed of populations of neurons that, by virtue of di¡erent combinations of intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic inputs, can express diverse responses to sound. As a result, the CN
consists of an array of neurons whose responses fall on
a continuum from a faithful preservation to a substantial transformation of the incoming a¡erent signals.
These responses are conveyed to higher auditory centers
along parallel pathways arising from the CN subdivisions.
Based on their responses to sounds, CN neurons
have been characterized according to two schemes :
temporal discharge patterns re£ected in the post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) scheme (e.g., Pfei¡er, 1966)
and the expressions of excitatory and inhibitory regions
and responsiveness to broad-band noise re£ected in the
excitatory-inhibitory area (EI-area) scheme (e.g.,
Young, 1984). The response types within the two
schemes appear to be distributed di¡erentially within
CN subdivisions and are correlated with di¡erent morphological classes of neurons in the CN. In the present
context, the anatomical and physiological diversity of
CN neurons gives rise to three important questions : (i)
Is echo representation among CN neurons di¡erent
from that among AN ¢bers? (ii) Do various physiological classes of CN neurons di¡er from one another with
respect to echo representation ? (iii) Are SR-based differences in echo processing of AN ¢bers also present in
the CN?
Recently, Wickesberg (1996) reported that ventral
cochlear nucleus (VCN) units showed rapid recovery
of the second-click response in the anesthetized chinchilla. Units characterized by primary-like and chopper
PSTHs showed 50% recovery by 2 ms interclick interval
and a nearly complete recovery by 4 ms. Wickesberg
also reported some variability in the responses of
VCN neurons, in that a subset exhibited little to no
reduction or enhanced response to the second click.
In this study we attempt to elucidate the contribution
of AVCN to echo processing. We systematically investigated the behaviors of AVCN neurons regarding their
response recovery functions under a click-pair stimulus
paradigm in decerebrate unanesthetized cats. In this
assessment of AVCN behavior in response to click
pairs, neurons were characterized according to both
PSTH and EI-area schemes and SR-based di¡erences
were investigated. Early results of this study were presented at a meeting of the Association for Research in
Otolaryngology (Kim et al., 1992).

2. Methods
The care and use of animals reported on in this study
were approved by the University of Connecticut Health
Center Animal Care Committee (protocol title: `Physiology of the Cochlear Nucleus'; protocol number: 91014-97-2). The details of Section 2 are described elsewhere (Parham et al., 1996). Brie£y, we used unanesthetized decerebrate cats. We opened the left posterior
fossa, aspirated a portion of the cerebellum, and exposed the CN. A micropipette was positioned over
the AVCN which was visualized through an operating
microscope. Single unit spike discharges were recorded
using micropipettes ¢lled with 3 M sodium chloride or
potassium acetate that had resistances of 20^50 M6. In
some penetrations the recording location was marked
by iontophoretic injection of markers, 10% biotinylated
dextran amine or 10% horseradish peroxidase in 0.5 M
potassium acetate in Tris bu¡er. As the electrode was
advanced, we applied a tonal search stimulus whose
frequency was swept with a triangular modulating
waveform over 0^50 kHz with a modulation repetition
period of 2 or 4 s. The level of the swept tone was in the
range of 40^60 dB SPL (re 20 WPa). For each AVCN
unit encountered, we recorded the following : (i) spontaneous discharge rate based on a 10- or 20-s sample
without acoustic stimulation; (ii) response area curve
representing discharges induced by 200-ms tone bursts
(two repetitions) at various frequencies spaced at 50
frequencies per decade on a logarithmic scale and at a
constant dB SPL, typically 10^30 dB SPL ; from the
response area we estimated the characteristic frequency
(CF) (the frequency to which a unit is most sensitive) of
the unit; (iii) responses to 60-dB SPL CF tone bursts
(50 ms duration, 500 ms repetition interval, 5 ms rise/
fall time, 60 repetitions) from which a post-stimulus
time histogram was constructed ; (iv) responses to 200ms noise bursts (three repetitions, 5 ms rise/fall; 1000
ms repetition interval) in 5-dB steps between 20^70 dB
SPL (measured as rms level with A-weighting) ; and (v)
responses to single rarefaction clicks and equilevel click
pairs with inter-click intervals (ICI) ranging from 1 to
32 ms ; repetition period of 500 ms, 40 repetitions, at 45,
65, 85 and 105 dB SPL peak. The rarefaction clicks
were produced by applying 30-Ws pulses to the earphone. The acoustic waveform of a single click recorded
in the concha of the cat is shown in Fig. 1.
Event times for spike discharges and stimulus
markers were stored with 20 Ws resolution in the data
¢les such that subsequent `o¡-line' analyses would have
access to full information about spike discharge and
stimulus events. Single units were classi¢ed according
to the PSTH and EI-area schemes. Discharges of all
units were examined for regularity based on the behavior of the coe¤cent of variation (CV) of spike discharges as a function of time (e.g., Young et al.,

which overlaps with W2 (for details see Parham et al.,
1996).
At each ICI the level dependent di¡erences between
SCRs of various unit types were statistically evaluated
using analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Signi¢cant interactions were followed up by lower order ANOVAs and
signi¢cant main e¡ects were further examined with Tukey HSD tests of mean comparisons.

1988 ; Parham and Kim, 1992). Chopper units were
subdivided into three subtypes : Chop-S (CV 6 0.35);
Chop-T (CV increased from 6 0.35 to s 0.35 within
the ¢rst 15 ms of the response) and Chop-O
(CV s 0.35). Based on PSTH of the responses to pure
tone at CF, onset units were identi¢ed based on a quantitative criterion that the ratio of the discharge rate over
the ¢rst 5 ms of the response (Ronset ) to the last 40 ms of
the response (Rsust .) be greater than 2.5.
The procedure for analysis of single unit responses to
click pairs is described in detail elsewhere (Parham et
al., 1996). Brie£y, we examined the response of each
AVCN unit to single clicks and click pairs in the
form of PSTHs with binwidths of 0.08 ms. For graphical illustrations binwidths of 0.2 or 0.4 ms were used.
To quantify the results, we de¢ned the time window
that included all of the evoked spike discharges to the
single click as W1. W1 was de¢ned for each unit and at
each click level because response latency and duration
varied among units and as a function of stimulus level.
W1 served as the reference time window for subsequent
computations of the responses to a click pair. The time
window of the response to the second click of a pair
(W2) was de¢ned as a window identical to W1 except
for a delay by the amount of ICI. The second-click
response (SCR) was expressed as percentage of the response to the ¢rst click. At short ICIs, the quanti¢cation of the SCR took into account the tail end of W1

This study is based on the responses of 121 AVCN
units recorded in 21 cats. Table 1 shows the number of
AVCN units subdivided according to the PSTH and EIarea schemes. In the PSTH scheme, the majority of the
units (93%) exhibited either primary-like (PL, 34%),
chopper (Chop, 47%) or onset (On, 12%) PSTHs. The
remaining units (7%) had unusual or non-descript
PSTH appearances. The PL group (N = 41) included
primary-like (98%) and primary-like-with-notch (2%)
PSTH types. The Chop group (N = 57) was further subdivided into sustained (Chop-S, 33%), transient (ChopT, 53%) and other (Chop-O, 14%) chopper subtypes.
The On group (N = 15) consisted of units exhibiting
onset without sustained discharges (On-I, 13%), onset
chopping (On-C, 47%), onset with low level of sustained activity (On-L, 33%) and onset followed by inhibition of spontaneous activity (On-inh, 7%). In the
EI-area scheme, the majority of the units (77%) were
characterized as Type I (5%), I/III (35%) or III (37%)
with a minority falling into other categories (Type II,
3%; Type IV, 1%). For the remaining 19% of the units,
response to broadband noise was unavailable and these
units were not classi¢ed in the EI-area scheme. Among
the present PL units, 18 out of 41 units were EI-area
Type III. This is a much greater tendency than a previous report (Shofner and Young, 1985). The reason for
this di¡erence is not clear.
Fig. 2 shows the responses of a low-SR PL/Type I/III
unit to single clicks and click pairs. Responses of this
unit to single clicks at 65 and 85 dB SPL peak are
shown in the top PSTHs of the two left-most columns.
The response was characterized by a large peak followed by a gradual decay of the response over 5^6

Fig. 2. The responses of a PL/Type I/III AVCN unit to clicks and click pairs. Upper right panel shows the PSTH of the response of this unit
to tone bursts at characteristic frequency (CF). The coe¤cients of variation (CV) for this unit were 0.62 and 0.57 in the 2^14.9 and 20^39.9-ms
time windows (called CVPÀIRXW and CVPHÀQWXW ), respectively. Responses to single click and click pairs at interclick intervals (ICI) between 1 and
16 ms at 65 and 85 dB SPL are shown in the two left columns. Lower right panel shows the second click response as a function of ICI at 45,
65 and 85 dB SPL and represents the percentage of recovery of second-click responses.

ms. Responses to click pairs at short ICIs (1^3 ms),
shown in the remaining rows of the two columns,
tended to be slightly more prolonged than the response
to single clicks. At larger ICIs the response to the second click was evident. As the ICI increased, the secondclick response gradually increased in strength such that
by 16-ms ICI, the second-click response was similar to
the ¢rst-click response. The lower right panel provides
the magnitude of the second-click response as a function of ICI at 45, 65 and 85 dB SPL. The second-click
response gradually recovered from near 25% at 1-ms
ICI to above 50% by 4-ms ICI and to near a complete
recovery (80^100%) by 16-ms ICI. This PL/Type I/III
unit exhibited a slower recovery of the second-click response as click level was increased from 45 to 85 dB
SPL.
The behavior of the sample PL/Type I/III unit shown
in Fig. 2 was typical of a majority of the units recorded
from the AVCN in this study (to be shown further
below) and resembled the behavior of AN ¢bers re-

corded under similar conditions (Parham et al., 1996).
However, a minority of the units exhibited responses to
click pairs that were distinct from the typical behavior
resembling AN ¢bers. The next ¢ve ¢gures (Figs. 3^7)
illustrate units characterized by sustained and transient
responses to pure tones that exhibited click pair responses that were distinct from that of the AN ¢bers.
The three examples shown in Figs. 3^5 exhibited
faster recovery of the second-click responses than AN
¢bers. The responses of a Chop-S/Type III AVCN unit
to single clicks and click pairs is shown in the two leftmost panels of Fig. 3. This unit's responses preserved
the representation of both clicks of a pair at low and
moderate stimulus levels (45 and 65 dB SPL), even at
ICIs as short as 1 ms. At 45 dB SPL, the PSTH of the
response of this unit to single clicks consisted of a single
narrow peak. At 1-ms ICI the response to the second
click is distinct and nearly equal to that of the ¢rst
click. At 85 dB SPL, the single click response consisted
of two peaks, separated by an interval (1.8 ms) which is

HEARES 3104 29-10-98

K. Parham et al. / Hearing Research 125 (1998) 131^146

approximately equal to the interpeak interval of the
PSTH of the response to the CF tone (upper right panel). The response to click pairs at 1-ms ICI was similar
to that of the single-click response except that the second peak of the PSTH was narrower and taller (i.e.,
distributed across fewer bins). A distinct response to
the second click was present at 2-ms ICI which gradually recovered as ICI was increased to 32 ms. The lower
right panel shows the second-click response recovery
functions of this unit. At 45 and 65 dB SPL the second-click response remained near 100% for all ICIs, but
at 85 dB SPL the second-click response recovered from
0% at 1-ms ICI to 100% at 32 ms.
The responses of another Chop-S/Type III AVCN
unit are shown in Fig. 4. This unit exhibited a poor
recovery of the second-click response at a low stimulus
level for ICIs even up to 32-ms ICI, but strong secondclick response at high stimulus level even at 1-ms ICI.
At 45 dB SPL a weak response to the second click was
present by 2-ms ICI. Unlike previous examples, however, second-click response was completely absent by 8ms ICI and remained below 50% for ICIs up to 32 ms.
In contrast, at 105 dB SPL the second-click response

135

was present at 1-ms ICI in the form of a broad peak.
By 2-ms ICI the second-click response was nearly the
same as that of the ¢rst. The second-click recovery
functions of this unit are shown in the lower right panel. At 45 dB SPL the second-click response remained
below 50%, but at 105 dB SPL the second-click response was recovered to 85^100% across all ICIs examined. At intermediate levels of 65 and 85 dB SPL the
second-click response exhibited more rapid recovery
than that expected from AN-like recoveries.
Fig. 5 shows the responses of an On-C/Type I/III
unit. At 65 dB SPL the second-click response was
strong ( s 75%) across all ICIs. At other click levels
the recovery of the second-click response was more
gradual, although somewhat faster than those exhibited
by AN ¢bers. For example, at 85 dB SPL the response
to the second click was greater than 75% at ICIs beyond 3 ms.
The next two examples shown in Figs. 6 and 7 exhibited slower recovery of the second-click response recovery function than AN ¢bers. The responses of a
Chop-T AVCN unit is shown in Fig. 6. The secondclick response of this unit at 45 dB SPL exhibited a

strong response at 1-ms ICI, but weak responses at 3^8ms ICIs. The second-click response at 65 dB SPL was
similar to that of 45 dB SPL (lower right panel). At 85
dB SPL this unit exhibited a more gradual recovery
(middle column and lower right panel).
The responses of an On-L/Type I/III AVCN unit are
shown in Fig. 7. This unit was characterized by a weak
second-click response up to 32-ms ICI for all stimulus
levels tested. Interestingly, the second-click response increased between 2- and 8-ms ICIs, but decreased for
longer ICIs.
Fig. 8 shows recovery functions for populations of
primary-like (left column), chopper (middle column)
and onset (right column) units at 45^105 dB SPL. Individual curves in Fig. 8 represent separate units, while
the thick line in each panel represents the mean secondclick response recovery function. In general, the majority of the units exhibited recovery functions qualitatively similar to those observed at the level of the
AN. However, a small number of non-AN-like recovery
functions were observed in all three populations. Examples of fast recovery to the second click can be seen in

primary-like (panel d), chopper (panels b, e and k) and
onset (panels c and f) units. Examples of weak response
to the second click can also be seen in primary-like
(panel g), chopper (panels b, e, h and k) and onset
(panels f, i and l) units.
The mean recovery functions of the three main
AVCN PSTH types are shown in Fig. 9a^c. Primarylike units showed little change in the mean second-click
response with the click level (Fig. 9a). Only at 16- and
32-ms ICIs were the second-click responses to 45 and 65
dB SPL signi¢cantly greater than those at 105 dB SPL
stimuli (Tukey HSD, P 6 0.05). Chopper units exhibited an orderly weakening of the mean second-click
response as click level was increased from 45 to 85 dB
SPL for 1^3-ms ICIs (Fig. 9b). However, at 105 dB SPL
the chopper units showed the strongest mean secondclick responses for 1^3-ms ICIs. The mean second-click
response of the onset units also decreased with increasing stimulus level (Fig. 9c). However, the level-dependent di¡erences among chopper and onset units were not
statistically signi¢cant (P s 0.05).
The mean second-click recovery functions of the

HEARES 3104 29-10-98

K. Parham et al. / Hearing Research 125 (1998) 131^146

three unit types were similar at 65 and 85 dB SPL. At
45 dB SPL the onset units exhibited more rapid recovery of the second-click to above 75% than the primarylike and chopper units (i.e., 3 vs. 4 ms, respectively).
However, at 105 dB SPL the onset units exhibited slower recovery of the second-click response than the primary-like and chopper units (75% SCR: 7 vs. 6 ms,
respectively). At 45 and 105 dB SPL the mean second-click recovery functions of the primary-like units
were intermediate to those of the chopper and onset
units. The di¡erences between the three PSTH types
were not statistically signi¢cant (P s 0.05).
The mean second-click recovery functions for the
three EI-area types are shown in Fig. 9d^f. The mean
second-click response of the Type I group increased as
the stimulus level increased from 65 to 85 dB SPL (Fig.
9d). Because of the small sample size for Type I units
mean second-click response recovery functions are not
available at 45 and 105 dB SPL. The mean second-click
response decreased from 45 to 85 dB SPL for Type I/III
and III units (Fig. 9e,f). However, at 105 dB SPL Type
I/III and III units showed an increase in the mean second-click responses relative to those at 85 dB SPL (Fig.

137

9e,f). The mean second-click response recovery functions of the three EIA types di¡ered little when compared at each click level.
Fig. 10 shows the SR distributions for AVCN units
recorded in this study and a sample of AN ¢bers recorded in a previous study (Kim et al., 1991). The
AVCN units were divided into low- ( 6 20 spikes/s,
N = 76, 63%) and high-SR ( s 20 spikes/s, N = 45,
37%) groups, as was previously done for AN ¢bers
(Parham et al., 1996). The mean second-click response
recovery functions of these two groups are shown in
Fig. 11. Low-SR AVCN units showed little level-dependent changes in the second-click response recovery
functions between 45 and 85 dB SPL. Interestingly, at
105 dB SPL the low-SR AVCN units exhibited stronger
second-click responses than at lower stimulus levels.
One-way ANOVAs at each ICI indicated a signi¢cant
main e¡ect of level only at the 2-ms ICI (F(3,124) =
3.42, P = 0.02). In contrast, the high-SR AVCN units
exhibited a more noticeable level-dependent decrease in
the second-click response between 45 and 105 dB SPL.
This decrease was statistically signi¢cant at 3-, 4- and 6ms ICIs (P 6 0.02). The mean recovery functions of the

two AVCN SR groups are compared to one another
and their AN counterparts in Fig. 12. At 45 and 65
dB SPL, the four populations exhibited similar second-click response recovery functions. One-way ANOVAs at 45 and 65 dB SPL showed no signi¢cant differences in mean second-click responses of the two SR
groups. At 85 dB SPL, the high-SR AVCN and AN
¢bers exhibited weaker second-click response recoveries
than their low-SR counterparts. Two-way ANOVAs at
each ICI at 85 dB SPL revealed main e¡ects of SR at all
ICIs less than 32 ms (P 6 0.05) without any signi¢cant
interaction with location (i.e., AN vs. CN).
At 105 dB SPL di¡erences in second-click response
between the low- and high-SR AVCN units are much
more evident, with the high-SR AVCN units having
weaker second-click response for ICIs less than 32 ms.
The AN data for 105 dB SPL are not available. ANOVAs indicated that the second-click responses of the
high-SR AVCN units were signi¢cantly weaker than
their low-SR counterparts at all ICIs less than 8 ms
(P 6 0.05).

Since the second-click response recovery functions
presented above are a relative measure, they do not
convey information about the absolute neural activities.
The latter information can be inferred by combining the
relative recovery functions with an absolute measure of
neural activities for various stimulus conditions. For
this purpose, we examined the number of spikes elicited
by single clicks at various levels, as shown in Fig. 13.
For all groups, the mean number of spikes elicited by
single clicks increased as the stimulus level increased
(Fig. 13a). However, this increase was substantially
larger for the high-SR AVCN and AN units. Consequently, the low-SR AVCN units and AN ¢bers consistently exhibited fewer spikes per click than their
high-SR counterparts across all levels. The duration
of the single-click response is shown in Fig. 13c.
Although the response duration increased as stimulus
level increased for all four groups, the response durations of high-SR AVCN units and AN ¢bers were
consistently longer than those of their low-SR counterparts.

4. Discussion
A majority of AVCN units recorded in this study
exhibited second-click response recovery time courses
that were similar to those of AN ¢bers. These units
had primary-like, chopper and onset PSTHs and Types
I, I/III and III EI-areas. A minority of AVCN units,
however, exhibited second-click responses whose recovery time courses were markedly reduced or prolonged
relative to those of AN ¢bers. The latter group of units
had primary-like, chopper and onset PSTHs and Type
I/III and III EI-areas. The mean second-click response
recovery functions showed little di¡erence among the
three main PSTH and EI-area types. When AVCN
units were subdivided into low- and high-SR groups,
however, a clear di¡erence in the second-click response
recovery functions was found between the two SR
groups.
In this study, the responses of many AVCN neurons
to single click stimuli were often prolonged. For example, multipeaked PSTHs of click responses were relatively common in low-CF (i.e., below 2 kHz) primarylike units. Similar to previous observations in the AN,

139

the PSTH of the responses of these low-CF primarylike units to clicks had a multi-peaked appearance, with
the interpeak interval being equal to the 1/CF interval.
Some high-CF CN units also had PSTHs of the response to click stimuli that were multi-peaked (e.g.,
Figs. 3, 5 and 6). However, as previously noted by
Kiang (1965), the inter-peak intervals in these highCF units did not correspond to 1/CF. Kiang's report
did not classify CN units according to the PSTH type.
In the current study, multi-peaked PSTHs among highCF units were associated with chopper and onset-chopper type units. The inter-peak intervals in the PSTHs of
the response to the clicks in these units approximated
those in the PSTHs of the responses to pure-tone bursts
at their CFs.
The level-dependent weakening of the second-click
responses of high-SR AVCN units and their slower recovery relative to low-SR AVCN units are analogous to
our earlier observations in the AN (Parham et al.,
1996). Spontaneous activities of AVCN neurons appear
to be mainly dependent on their AN inputs. Koerber et
al. (1966) observed that, after cochlear destruction,
spontaneous activity of AVCN neurons was abolished

suggesting that SR of AVCN neurons mainly arises
from their AN a¡erent inputs. Therefore, the di¡erences between the two SR groups in the AVCN for the
most part appear to be a re£ection of their AN a¡erent
inputs.
The results presented in this report o¡er a possible
reason for the di¡erence in the dependence of the second-click response on the level between the two SR
populations of the AN and AVCN, i.e., neuronal refractoriness. Gaumond et al. (1982) characterized refractoriness of AN ¢bers in terms of a conditional discharge probability conditioned on the time since the last
spike, called tau, for a steady stimulus. The conditional
discharge probability of an AN ¢ber typically was zero
(i.e., completely refractory) for tau 6 0.75 ms, rapidly

increased from zero to about 60% of a fully recovered
value at tau = 4 ms, and more gradually increased to the
fully recovered value (i.e., zero refractoriness) between
4 and about 40 ms. Gaumond et al., 1982 (Figs. 12 and
13) also observed that, when there were successive short
(e.g., 6 10 ms) interspike intervals, the refractoriness of
AN ¢bers was accumulated, i.e., the conditional discharge probability further decreased. The fact that the
time courses (0 to about 40 ms) and general shapes of
the two measures, i.e., second-click response vs. interclick interval and refractoriness vs. time since the last
spike, are quite comparable to each other, supports the
possibility that neuronal refractoriness is the main
mechanism underlying the reduction and a gradual recovery of the second-click response being described in

HEARES 3104 29-10-98

the present report and in Parham et al. (1996). In Fig.
13a, it is seen that, as the stimulus level was increased
from 45 to 105 dB SPL, the mean absolute number of
spikes increased from about 1 to 3 spikes per click for
high-SR AN and AVCN units whereas they changed
little for low-SR AN and AVCN units. It is also seen
in Fig. 13c that the multiple spikes at high stimulus
levels occurred over a period of about 4^10 ms. This
corresponds to interspike intervals of about 2^4 ms.
In view of the Gaumond et al. study discussed above,
the refractoriness of a high-SR unit should be substantially greater during a period following the clicks presented at high levels than that at low levels because
additional spikes were discharged with short interspike
intervals at high stimulus levels. This expected change

141

in the amount of refractoriness of high-SR units with
stimulus level is consistent with the decrease of secondclick response observed in high-SR AVCN units (Fig.
11) and AN ¢bers (Parham et al., 1996, Fig. 7). Likewise, this reasoning as applied to low-SR units regarding their absolute number of spikes per click being
nearly independent of stimulus level (Fig. 13a) predicts
that their second-click response recovery functions
should be nearly independent of stimulus level. LowSR AVCN units (Fig. 11) and AN ¢bers (Parham et
al., 1996, Fig. 7) indeed exhibited much less dependence
of their second-click recovery functions on stimulus level than their high-SR counterparts, largely consistent
with the prediction. There is one discrepancy between
the refractoriness-based prediction and the observation

SPL). Mean recovery function for Type I units at 45 and 105 dB SPL are not available due to the small sample size.

in this regard. That is, the second-click response of lowSR AVCN units increased somewhat at 105 dB SPL
compared with those at lower levels (Fig. 11, left panel)
whereas, based on Fig. 13, one predicts that it should
remain nearly constant with a slight decrease. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.
When one considers that the discharge behavior of
an AVCN neuron is a¡ected by neuronal refractoriness,
two components of refractoriness can be considered: (i)
refractoriness of AN ¢bers acting as an input to the
AVCN neuron, and (ii) refractoriness of the AVCN
neuron. The present observations (Fig. 12) indicate
that the second-click response recovery functions are

rather similar between the AN ¢bers and AVCN neurons. In interpreting the second-click response recovery
functions in terms of neuronal refractoriness, this similarity implies that the combined total refractoriness
observed in AVCN units is similar to that in AN ¢bers.
To our knowledge, direct examinations of neuronal refractoriness (analogous to the Gaumond et al. study)
for AVCN neurons have not been reported. We believe
that such a study should be useful.
The faster recovery of the second-click response of
low-SR AN ¢bers and AVCN neurons than their highSR counterparts contrasts with ¢ndings of forward
masking studies using tone bursts at the level of the
AN (Relkin and Pelli, 1987; Relkin and Doucet,
1991) and CN (Boettcher et al., 1990; Shore, 1995).
Forward masking studies noted that low-SR units required longer times for recovery of responses to tone
bursts than high-SR units, opposite of the present observation of the second-click response. Previously, we
considered that possible reasons for the discrepancy
might include longer signal duration (tone burst) and
a large level di¡erence between the masker and probe in
the forward masking studies compared with click pairs
of the present studies (Parham et al., 1996). Even when
the masker and probe levels were nearly equal in the
CN forward masking studies, low-SR neurons showed
slower recovery than high-SR neurons (Boettcher et al.,
1990 ; Shore, 1995). Therefore, the di¡erence between
masker and probe levels does not explain the discrepancy between click-pair and forward masking studies.
Di¡erent mechanisms may underlie the two phenomena. Adaptation at the inner hair cell and its a¡erent
synapse and suppression of cochlear responses mediated
by the olivocochlear e¡erent system (Bon¢ls and Puel,
1987) may mainly underlie the forward masking phenomenon whereas neuronal refractoriness may mainly
underlie the second-click response reduction phenomenon. We do not expect that the second-click response
recovery function is mainly mediated by the e¡erent
system because the click stimulus had a brief duration

(Fig. 1) presented with a long (500 ms) repetition period, whereas e¡erent-mediated e¡ect required a su¤ciently long (greater than 35 ms) stimulus (Bon¢ls and
Puel, 1987).
The similarity of the recovery rates of low- and highSR AVCN neurons to their AN counterparts supports
the notion that SR may be an important axis in signal
representation at the level of the CN. This conclusion is
consistent with that of Shore (1995) in her study of
forward masking in the VCN. The suggestion of an
SR-based segregation of AN ¢ber projections to the
CN, ¢rst made by anatomical studies (Leake and
Snyder, 1989 ; Kawase and Liberman, 1992; Liberman,
1991), has received additional neurophysiological support. Recent recordings from the AVCN showed that
neurons in the marginal shell were predominantly low
SR, whereas the central core included high- and low-SR
neurons (Ghoshal and Kim, 1996, 1997).
Since a majority of the AVCN units display AN-like
behavior with respect to second-click responses, these
neurons do not modify the AN a¡erent inputs but act
to relay AN signals to higher auditory centers. In a
forward masking study of CN neurons, Boettcher et
al. (1990) arrived at a similar conclusion. A minority
of AVCN units, however, showed echo processing behaviors that were distinct from those of the AN ¢bers.
These units had primary-like, chopper and onset PSTH
types. Forward masking studies in the CN have also
identi¢ed neurons whose recovery from short-term
adaptation is distinct from those of AN ¢bers (Boettcher et al., 1990; Shore, 1995). In vivo intracellular

recording and labeling experiments have shown that
PSTH types tend to be associated with morphological
cell types in the AVCN (Rhode et al., 1983; Rouiller
and Ryugo, 1984 ; Smith and Rhode, 1987, 1989; Ostapo¡ et al., 1994). For example, the primary-like responses are generally associated with bushy cells,
whereas chopper responses are generally associated
with multipolar cells. Since the unusual second-click
recovery behaviors of some AVCN neurons were not
associated with a distinct response type in the AVCN,
the present observation suggests that these novel echo
processing strategies may not be associated with a
unique cell type in the AVCN.
The unusual echo processing patterns of AVCN neurons consisted of neurons with either enhanced or suppressed representation of the echo relative to that of the
AN ¢bers. The enhancement of the second-click response was observed at short ICIs (i.e., less than 4 ms)
where individual AN ¢bers show typically weak
responses (less than 50% ; Parham et al., 1996). The
present study is the ¢rst to demonstrate the existence
of neurons with very fast second-click response recovery times in the AVCN. One possible way to extract
adequate information regarding the temporal position
of an echo, is for some AVCN neurons to sample and
integrate the responses of many AN ¢bers. In other
words, convergence of several AN ¢ber inputs onto
an AVCN neuron could lead to summation of temporally coincident excitatory post-synaptic potentials thus
eliciting an action potential. This is analogous to previously proposed mechanisms for certain VCN neurons

Fig. 13. Mean spike counts (a), absolute number of spikes (b) and
mean response duration (c) in response to single clicks as a function
of stimulus level among low- and high-SR AN ¢bers and AVCN
units at four stimulus levels (45, 65, 85 and 105 dB SPL).

(e.g., Smith and Rhode, 1986; Winter and Palmer,
1995 ; Palmer et al., 1996). Responses of spherical bushy
cells in the AVCN are dominated by their AN ¢ber
inputs which are believed to be form one or two calyx-type endings on one bushy cell (e.g., Sento and
Ryugo, 1989). Therefore, the spherical bushy cells are
a poor candidate for this type of integration. More
likely candidates are multipolar cells receiving boutontype endings from the AN which are distributed over
their soma and proximal dendrites (Cant, 1981).
The suppression of the second-click responses beyond that exhibited by the AN ¢bers is likely mediated
by circuits releasing inhibitory neurotransmitters such
as glycine and/or GABA in some CN neurons (Backo¡
et al., 1997). Suppression of the second-click response
of AVCN neurons could arise partly from intranuclear
and/or descending inhibitory projections to AVCN neurons. The intranuclear mechanisms that may underlie
such suppression have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Wickesberg and Oertel, 1990; Wickesberg,

1996). Brie£y, one hypothesized source is the tuberculoventral neurons of the DCN which provide glycinergic input to the AVCN. In vitro excitation of these
neurons through stimulation of AN ¢bers which project
to tuberculoventral neurons, as well as AVCN neurons,
showed inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in AVCN
neurons about 2 ms after AN induced excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Wickesberg (1996) provided further
support for this circuit in a pharmacological perturbation study. Wickesberg showed that, following application of lidocaine in the DCN, responses of 19% of the
VCN units (primary-like and chopper type) to the trailing click increased. Such inputs could account for the
trough-like recovery functions observed in this study
(e.g., Fig. 6). For 62% of the VCN units, however,
Wickesberg found that the response to the ¢rst click
decreased after lidocaine administration. The reason
for the latter unexpected ¢nding is not clear.
In the AVCN, ICI at 50% recovery of the secondclick response ranged from 1.8 ms at 45 dB SPL to 3 ms
at 85 dB SPL without any substantial di¡erences between the two AVCN SR groups (Fig. 12). This compares with 1.3^3 ms over the same stimulus level range
in the AN (Parham et al., 1996). Thus, there was only a
very slight increase in the average 50% recovery time in
AVCN relative to the AN. The recovery functions of
AVCN units are similar to those reported for units in
the SOC by Fitzpatrick et al. (1995). Monaural units in
the SOC exhibited second-click recovery functions that
were analogous to those of AVCN neurons. The average 50% recovery time of monaural units in the SOC
was V2 ms (Fitzpatrick et al., 1995). The fact that
recovery functions in the SOC are comparable to those
in the AVCN with the average 50% recovery times
being similar in the two nuclei suggests that no signi¢cant modi¢cation of the echo processing occurs between
these two structures. Substantial alterations apparently
occur higher up at the level of the IC as the average
50% recovery time increases to V6^20 ms (Yin, 1994;
Fitzpatrick et al., 1995). Additional suppression mechanisms are interpreted to be present in the cortex, since
in the auditory cortex the average 50% recovery times
ranged up to 300^500 ms (Fitzpatrick et al., 1997,
1998).
Some of the auditory cortical neurons were observed
to exhibit rapid recovery times of 6 2 ms (Fitzpatrick
et al., 1997). Considering that the AVCN also contains
neurons exhibiting comparably rapid recovery times
(e.g., Figs. 3^5), the projections of such AVCN neurons
could form the beginning of a channel that may convey
information about the presence and nature of echoes.
Such information may underlie the quality of the sound
heard, i.e., its timbre (e.g., Blauert, 1997; Harris et al.,
1963 ; Sayers and Toole, 1964). The projections from
the majority of AVCN neurons, whose second-click responses recovery times are 2^10 ms, may represent the

HEARES 3104 29-10-98

K. Parham et al. / Hearing Research 125 (1998) 131^146

beginning of a separate channel that may underlie the
perception of the sound location, thus mediating the
precedence e¡ect which has a time window of about
2^10 ms (Wallach et al., 1949). In addition, certain
neurons in the AVCN (present study) and higher auditory centers (e.g., Fitzpatrick et al., 1995, 1997), whose
second-click recovery times are in the range of about
ten to a few hundred milliseconds, may mediate a time
window (`echo window') where a lagging sound (i.e.,
echo) is heard but its perception is still a¡ected by a
leading sound (Fitzpatrick et al., 1998).
Based on the ¢ndings of our studies in the AN and
AVCN, it is important in future studies to keep in mind
two important variables: SR and stimulus level. In both
AN and AVCN, the 50% recovery time of the secondclick response increased from 1.3 and 1.8 ms, respectively, to 3 ms between 45 and 85 dB SPL. At 105 dB
SPL, however, the 50% recovery time for low-SR
AVCN neurons was less than 1.5 ms, while that of
high-SR AVCN neurons was V5 ms. Results for the
AN at 105 dB SPL are not available for comparison.
Given that both SR and stimulus level exert a substantial in£uence on echo processing, greater attention
needs to be paid to these variables when making comparisons across structures.
Regarding psychophysical studies of precedence effect which examined the in£uence of the overall stimulus level, we are aware of only one, Shinn-Cunningham et al. (1993). Using two stimulus levels (80 and 110
dB SPL 1-ms noise bursts), they found: (i) that the
stimulus level had relatively small in£uence on the
strength of the precedence e¡ect; (ii) that the strength
of the precedence e¡ect was little a¡ected by the stimulus level for 1-ms ICI (or `lag' of Shinn-Cunningham
et al.) ; and (iii) that the strength of the precedence
e¡ect tended to decrease somewhat at the higher stimulus level for 10-ms ICI. This psychophysical observation of a decrease of the precedence e¡ect strength with
increasing stimulus level for 10-ms ICI appears to be in
opposite direction to what one may anticipate from the
neurophysiological observations of an increase of the
recovery time with increasing stimulus level (Fig. 11
of the present paper ; Figs. 7 and 11 of Parham et al.,
1996). The reason for this apparent discrepancy is not
clear.
To summarize, a survey of the available results
throughout the auditory pathway suggests that the response to a trailing sound or echo can be either weakened (a characteristic of the AN ¢bers), enhanced or
suppressed. As we ascend the auditory pathway, suppression appears to become more robust or prolonged,
but an enhanced representation of a simulated echo
continues to persist. These results suggest that, with
respect to echo processing, the CN may be the origin
of several parallel channels within which the AN signal
is either relayed or altered on its way to higher centers.
