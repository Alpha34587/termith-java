Background: A survey of oncologists was conducted in Italy to evaluate the potential problems of physician–patient
discussion about hormonal switch in the adjuvant therapy of breast cancer.

Materials and methods: A questionnaire, including both closed and open-ended questions, was administered to
70 oncologists. Fifty-one of them returned completely ﬁlled questionnaires.
that they found it difﬁcult to make the therapeutic change acceptable to patients. The oncologist’s barriers to propose
the switch were related mostly to scientiﬁc and economic issues, such as the lack of certain advantages of aromatase
inhibitors over tamoxifen (28%), their costs (14%) and their side-effects (34%). On the other hand, according to
physicians, the patient’s barriers to accept the therapeutic change were mainly due to psychological–relational factors,
in particular the anxiety produced by the change (40%) and the bad patient–physician communication experienced in
the past (26%).
Conclusions: Patient–physician communication difﬁculties about switch strategy in the adjuvant hormonal treatment
of breast cancer are, at least in part, related to psychological and relational factors. It is likely that training programs,
improving doctor’s communication skills, can overcome these problems.
Key words: breast cancer, hormonal switch, patient anxiety, physician–patient communication, recurrence risk

introduction
Communication between physicians and patients is
a fundamental aspect of cancer care [1, 2]. The beneﬁts of good
communication skills include a positive impact on patient
symptoms and side-effects, treatment adherence, anxiety and
satisfaction of both the patient and doctor [3, 4]. One of the
most important yet challenging task of physicians is breaking
‘bad news’ [5, 6], deﬁned as any information that adversely
alters one’s expectations for the future. Randomized trials
focused on the delivery of bad news, such as severe diagnosis,
progression of disease and poor prognosis, have demonstrated
that training programs for physicians are able to improve their
communication and relational skills and also patient outcomes
[7–12].
Physician–patient communication plays a critical role also in
the decision making about adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast

cancer [13, 14]. Patient’s knowledge of the mechanism of
action and the risk/beneﬁt ratio of prescribed drug is predictive
of adherence to medical treatment [15]. Suboptimal
communication of the risk of relapse could result in
unnecessary psychological distress for those women
overestimating their risk and in nonadherence to treatment of
those who believe they are at less risk of recurrence. The
adherence and persistence to therapy has become an important
issue in oncology practice with the increased availability of
effective endocrine agents administered orally daily and for
several years [16]. It has been observed that in breast cancer
patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, the adherence to
treatment gradually declined during the 4 years following the
initiation of treatment [17]. It is likely that an effective
communication is required also when doctor has to
communicate the utility of switching to another endocrine
agent to patients who have already had tamoxifen therapy for
2–3 years.
For a long time, 5 years of tamoxifen has been the standard of
care for pre- and postmenopausal women with endocrine-sensitive

early breast cancer, being associated with a 41% relative
reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 34% relative reduction
in the risk of death [18]. During the last several years, the preeminence of tamoxifen in postmenopausal setting has been
challenged by the aromatase inhibitors (AIs), such as
anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Large, randomized trials
have demonstrated that the use of adjuvant AIs compared with 5
years of tamoxifen results in a relative improvement in diseasefree survival (DFS) of 13%–40% and in some cases also in
overall survival (OS) [19]. AIs have been found to be superior to
tamoxifen irrespective of whether they are given straightaway,
instead of tamoxifen for 5 years (upfront strategy), after 2–3
years of tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of treatment (switch
strategy) or following completion of 5 years of tamoxifen
(extended strategy). Data from these studies establish AIs as
a standard component of adjuvant endocrine therapy for
postmenopausal women, even if the optimal treatment
modality has yet to be deﬁned. Based on the available evidence,
either an upfront or sequential approach is reasonable [20–23].
If our goal is to minimize recurrences in the ﬁrst 2–3 years of
therapy, the choice should be an AI upfront. This strategy may
be more appropriate than switch in patients at high risk of early
recurrence, even if in the initial AI trials no difference in OS has
emerged [23]. On the contrary, in the Intergroup Exemestane
Study trial, in which postmenopausal women who were disease
free after 2–3 years of tamoxifen were randomized to switch to
exemestane or to continue with tamoxifen for a total of 5 years,
a survival advantage has been observed for the switching group
[22]. Because the ultimate objective is to maximize OS and
quality of life, it may be reasonable to accept a small, short-term
disadvantage in DFS with the real hope that the sequential use of
two, non-cross-resistant agents will lead to an improvement in
long-term outcomes [24]. Moreover, the natural history of
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is very long, and thus,
especially patients with low risk of early recurrence might
beneﬁt from sequential use of two, non-cross-resistant agents.
Thus, switching to an AI (exemestane or anastrozole) for
patients who have already had tamoxifen therapy for 2–3 years
appear to be an appropriate strategy for the majority of early
breast cancer patients [20, 25, 26].
No previous study has investigated the communication
difﬁculties of oncologists when they propose a new hormonal
treatment regimen and the process by which this occurs. It is
possible that the hormonal switch in a patient taking tamoxifen
for 2–3 years can reawaken the risk of disease recurrence and
death, in a moment in which the patient’s cancer is framed ‘in
the past’ [16]. For these reasons, discussing with patient about
adjuvant hormonal switch can be particularly difﬁcult. With
this in mind, we have interviewed a sample of 70 oncologists in
order to evaluate the potential problems regarding the
physician–patient communication about hormonal switch.

materials and methods
A questionnaire aimed at evaluating the opinion on the potential problems
related to the physician–patient discussion about hormonal switch was
administered to 70 oncologists attending a refresher course. Fifty-one of
them returned completely ﬁlled questionnaires. The mean age of the
physician population was 39.4 6 10.0; 52% of them were from North Italy,

1648 | Costantini et al.

Annals of Oncology

31% from Central Italy and 17% from South Italy; 63% were women and
37% were men. They were mostly oncologists (88%). Physician
characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
The questionnaire was distributed at the time of registration at the
meeting, and it was completed before the beginning of the meeting. The
questionnaire investigated aspects of physician’s experience on proposing
the hormonal switch to patient. In particular, it focused on frequency and
level of difﬁculty related to different problems that physician could
encounter in two speciﬁc areas: (i) proposing a new hormonal treatment
and (ii) making this change acceptable for patient. The level of difﬁculty
was rated on a Likert scale based on ﬁve response categories (strongly
disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree). The
problems relating to discussion about hormonal switch were as follows: (i)
patient does not know why she is taking tamoxifen; (ii) the patient has no
side-effects with tamoxifen and she does not want to change medication;
(iii) the patient is afraid of change; (iv) the patient does not know the risk
of recurrence; (v) the patient has a history of anxiety and depression; (vi)
the patient experienced unknown side-effects with tamoxifen, and thus, she
is distrustful of other side-effects of new therapy and (vii) the physician
does not want to frighten the patient discussing extensively the side-effects
of a new treatment. Moreover, some other questions also probed additional
areas related to the oncologists’ perceptions of personal barriers to changing
therapy.
Data were analyzed using SPSS v15.0. Groups have been compared using
the v2 test (with correction for continuity in 2 · 2 tables) or, if more
appropriate, the Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s ttest for continuous variables. We used an alpha level of 0.05 for all statistical
tests.

results
The surveyed physicians reported that they had considerable
experience in discussing the hormonal switch, with a mean
number of 9.8 6 8.7 patients monthly in the last year.

Forty-seven percent (N = 24) of physicians reported
difﬁculties in proposing the hormonal switch, whereas 53%
(N = 27) reported no difﬁculties. Thirty physicians (60%)
stated that they found it difﬁcult to make the therapeutic
change acceptable to patients, whereas 20 (40%) stated that
they had no problems in this regard. One physician did not
reply to the latter question.
The ﬁndings of the comparison between physicians who
reported difﬁculties on proposing hormonal switch and those
who reported no difﬁculties are detailed in Tables 2–4.
No signiﬁcant differences between the two groups were
observed with regard to age; sex; degree seniority; years of
oncology clinical practice; working function and institution;
time allocated to managerial, educational and clinical aspects;
time allocated to discussing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
options with patient and monthly number of patient–physician
encounters about adjuvant hormonal switch (Table 2).

Compared with the physicians who experienced no
difﬁculties in proposing hormonal switch, those who had
difﬁculties in proposing hormonal switch reported that they
faced more often (Table 3) and with greater difﬁculty (Table 4)
the following problems: (i) patient does not have side-effects
with tamoxifen and she does not want to change medication;
(ii) patient is afraid of change; (iii) patient does not know its
risk of recurrence; (iv) patient does not know why she takes
tamoxifen and (v) patient is anxious or depressed.
As summarized in Table 2, no signiﬁcant differences were
observed between the oncologists who reported difﬁculties in
making the hormonal switch acceptable to patients and those
who experienced no difﬁculties with regard to age; sex; degree
seniority; years of oncology clinical practice; working function
and institution; time allocated to managerial, educational and
clinical aspects; time allocated to discussing diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment options with patient and monthly

number of patient–physician encounters about adjuvant
hormonal switch.
Compared with the physicians who experienced no
difﬁculties in making the hormonal switch acceptable to
patients, those who had difﬁculties in making the hormonal
switch acceptable to patients reported that they faced more
often (Table 3) and with greater difﬁculty (Table 4) the
following problems: (i) patient does not have side-effects with
tamoxifen and she does not want to change medication; (ii)
patient is afraid of change and (iii) patient does not know her
risk of recurrence. Also, they faced more often the problem that
the patient does not know why she takes tamoxifen.
Responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed and
different categories of response have been identiﬁed. In this
regard, the categories of response concerning the oncologist’s
barriers were as follows: (i) cost of new drug; (ii) side-effects of
new drug; (iii) lack of certain advantages and (iv) paucity of
available information on new endocrine agent. The identiﬁed
categories regarding patient’s barriers were as follows:
(i) anxiety produced by the change in the treatment plan;
(ii) concerns about possible side-effects of new medication;
(iii) bad communication experienced by patient in the past and
(iv) good tolerability of tamoxifen.
To the open-ended question ‘Which barriers meet
oncologists on proposing the hormonal switch to patient?’ 28%
answered that there was a lack of certain advantages with the
new drug; 14% referred to the cost of new medication; 34%
focused on the possible side-effects related to new therapy and
24% to the paucity of scientiﬁc information about the new
drug.
To the other open question ‘Which are the principal patient’s
barriers to accept the hormonal switch?’ 40% answered that this
was caused by the anxiety produced by the change in the
treatment plan; 26% by the possible side-effects of new

1650 | Costantini et al.

medication; 26% by bad information received by the patient in
the past and 8% by good tolerability of tamoxifen.
In regard to the open question about the oncologist’s barriers
on ‘proposing’ the hormonal switch, there was a trend (P <
0.10) toward a higher percentage of oncologists in the group
that experienced ‘difﬁculties in proposing the switch’ (9 versus
2 in the group that did not report difﬁculties) to report
uncertainty about the advantages of the new drug and paucity
of available information as oncologist’s barriers to discuss the
switch. On the contrary, no differences have been observed
between the two groups (ﬁve in both groups) about the costs
and side-effects of new drug, as physician’s barriers. Moreover,
no differences between the two oncologists’ groups have been
observed about the patient’s barriers to accept the change in her
treatment plan.
In regard to the open question about the oncologist’s barriers
on proposing the hormonal switch, a signiﬁcantly higher
percentage of oncologists in the group that reported ‘difﬁculties
in making the switch acceptable’ (10 versus 1 in the group of
those who did not report difﬁculties) reported uncertainty
about the advantages of the new drug and paucity of available
information, as oncologist’s barriers to discuss the switch. On
the contrary, no differences have been observed between the
two groups (ﬁve in both groups) about the costs and sideeffects of new drug, as physician’s barriers. Moreover, no
differences between the two oncologists’ groups have been
observed about the patient’s barriers to accept the change in her
treatment plan.

discussion
Our study conﬁrms and extends previous ﬁndings [13] on the
critical role of physician–patient communication about
adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer, particularly

focusing on oncologists’ difﬁculties to propose the hormonal
switch from tamoxifen to AI. The two major limitations of our
study are as follows: ﬁrst, the small sample size that it is not
representative of Italian oncologists as a whole and secondly,
the results refer to physicians’ opinion about their retrospective
experiences and should be interpreted in the context of Italian
culture, in which the patient–physician relationship is shifting
over time from a paternalistic approach to a patient-centered
model.
Forty-seven percent of surveyed physicians reported
difﬁculties in proposing the switch and 60% in making this
change acceptable for patient. The physician’s barriers to
propose the switch are related mostly to scientiﬁc and
economic issues, such as the lack of certain advantages of AIs
over tamoxifen, their costs, their side-effects (e.g. osteoporosis)
and paucity of individual information about these new
compounds. On the contrary, psychological–relational factors
are mainly responsible for the patient’s barriers to accept the
therapeutic change, in particular the anxiety produced by the
change and the poor patient–physician communication
experienced in the past. Physicians that referred difﬁculties to
propose the hormonal switch have reported situations in which
patients are afraid of change, do not know their risk of
recurrence, do not know why they take tamoxifen or they are
anxious and depressed. On the other hand, physicians that have
experimented difﬁculties in making the hormonal switch
acceptable for patient reported situations in which patient is
afraid of change and she does not know its recurrence risk
very well.
Switching to an AI after 2–3 years of tamoxifen results in
a signiﬁcant improvements in DFS compared with 5 years of
tamoxifen alone and provides a small advantage in OS [20, 22].
We do not know if the difﬁculties in proposing hormonal
switch and in making this acceptable for patient hamper the
starting of a more beneﬁcial treatment in the clinical practice.
However, it is likely that this can occur in some cases. Our data
show that difﬁculties are, at least in part, related to
psychological and relational factors, and thus, it is possible to
overcome these problems improving physician’s
communication skills. Good communication skills are required
in the management of anxious and depressed women or for
women who do not know their recurrence risk very well or do
not know why they take tamoxifen. In all these cases, it is
necessary to discuss the delicate issue of the risk of disease
recurrence and OS.
In the present study, no difference was observed between
physicians that reported difﬁculties in proposing the switch and
in making this therapeutic change acceptable for patient and
those who have not reported any problems with regard to age,
sex, degree seniority, years of oncology clinical practice,
working function and institution. This suggests that senior
doctors meet the same communication difﬁculties as their
more junior colleagues.
Breast cancer patients desire more information about their
disease and potential treatments than that they receive [27]. It
has been shown that patient satisfaction is improved when
physician’s communication style meets the patient’s
information needs. However, many studies have reported that
the physicians’ perception of patients’ information needs and

Volume 20 | No. 10 | October 2009

decision-making preferences is inadequate [28, 29]. Moreover,
discussing the adjuvant hormonal therapy, most of physicians
do not try to be aware of patients’ preferences for making
treatment decisions, and they use the same communication
style with all patients, without verify if patient understands the
large amounts of received information [28, 30]. The above
reported data explain, at least in part, the difﬁculties in
discussing the hormonal switch in an advanced phase of
treatment path.
In conclusion, it has been found that the patient–physician
communication about switch from tamoxifen to AI is difﬁcult.
In particular, difﬁculties are related, at least in part, to the
fact that patient has to face again the issue of recurrence risk
and she has not received in the past adequate information
about the mechanism of tamoxifen action, its risk/beneﬁt ratio
and the risk of disease recurrence. Several communication
challenges are placed to a doctor that wishes to realize an
effective discussion about hormonal switch based on
a patient-centered approach. These challenges include
understanding what patient already knows about its disease,
understanding the level at which patient desires to be
involved in decision-making process, delivering essential
information avoiding patient’s confusion and correcting
wrong patient’s convictions, being sympathetic toward patient,
e.g. with regard to its anxiety for change, verifying the
understanding level of patient, verifying potential causes for
suboptimal adherence to tamoxifen, resuming all discussion
points, and thus, presenting a shared treatment plan. This
information process does not necessarily require more time,
but of course it requires relational skills and the knowledge of
psychological structure of communication. Randomized
trials suggest that communication skills and psychological
techniques for patient–physician relationship do not
necessarily improve with years of medical practice alone since
they are based on mental attitudes that can be taught and
learned through evidence-based standardized methods [7, 8,
11]. In this regard, training courses to improve oncologists’
communication skills have been promoted also in Italy in the
last few years [12].
Some of principles at the base of an effective communication
model can be adapted also to the information process and
treatment decision making regarding adjuvant endocrine
therapy and particularly the hormonal switch discussion. In
fact, some of the oncologists’ difﬁculties reported in this study
can be related to poor physician’s communication skills leading
to have problems in proposing a new therapeutic option for
a disease with high emotional impact.
