Theautbors examined tbe interrelationships between low
vision, depression, andfunctioning in older adults. Seventy patients over age 65 attending a low-vision clinic
were interviewed by a geriatric nurse-practitioner, using
a structured clintcal format to diagnose depression according to DSM-I/I-R criteria. In all, 38.6% ofpatients met
criteria for major depression. There was no association
between depression and severity of visual impairment,
but a direct relationship was found between depression
and functional impairment. Depression was tbe most
powerful variable associated with functional impairment (adjusted If = 0.20; P < 0.0001). Depression frequently co-occurs with visual impairment in tbis
population. Appropriate recognition and treatment may
reduce functional disability and improve quality oflife.

isual impainnent is one of the most
common and disabling conditions
encountered in late life. Older individuals
represent more than half of aU legally
blind persons and 70% ofseverely Visually
impaired persons. I Within the next 20
years, these numbers are expected to increase dramatically.2 Despite these facts,
the current literature on vision and aging

neither adequately nor systematically examines the complex psychological issues
involved with aging and vision loss. The
gerontologica1literatute focuses only infrequently on visual impairment and
rarely addresses low vision and depression.3A Recent studies examining function have documented the adverse effect
ofvision impairment on daily functioning

Depression and Low Vision
in elderly people.5-9 Another study found
that visual Impairment increased the risk
ofboth depression and functional dlsability.IO The literature on blindness and depression primarily concerns children and
young adults. Among them, depression
frequently occurs, tends to persist, and
impairs functional ability over and above
the effect of blindness alone. 11.12
To our knowledge, no studies have
directly examined the effects of both depression and low vision on functioning in
elderly patients. Because low vision is
prevalent in older people and because
depression is suspected to be common
and only infrequently recognized or
treated, we studied older patients attending a low-vision clinic at an urban eye
hospital to evaluate the impact ofdepression in this population.

METHODS
Subjects
We used a convenience sample of 70
patients attending the Low VISion Clinic
of the Wills Eye Hospital 2 days per week
from July 1992 to October 1993. The patients had a variety of eye disorders and
were referred by their ophthalmologists
for optical aids. The most prevalent eye
disease was macular degeneration
(61.4%), then cataracts (31.4%), glaucoma (21.4%), diabetic retinopathy
(15.7%). and other conditions (5.7%). Of
this group, 25 patients (35.7%) had two
or more concurrent conditions.

forms, and the Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS), the DSM-llI-R Checklist for Depression, and the Functional Assessment
Scale (FAS) were then completed. 13-15
The GDS is a 3().item~ self-rating scale
eliciting psychological symptoms such as
low mood, hopelessness, and suicidal
ideation. 130 The FAS measures functioning
in activities of daily living (ADLs),such as
bathing or dressing. and instrumental
ADLs,such as shopping or paying bills. It
was used in the East Baltimore Mental
Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area
Survey on a sample of approximately
175,000 adults. IS The DSM-IlI-R checklist
was used to determine whether patients
met the criteria for major depressive disorders. 14
One geriatric nurse-practitioner conducted all interviews. The reliability of
her assessments was evaluated by having
a second clinician present during the examination of a subsamplc of 10 patients,
and a high degree ofinterrater agreement
was found by this method (kappa =
0.94).
Visual acuity was measured in the
standard wa~ using the Snellen eye chart.
Data Analysis

For comparison of continuous and
categorical data, r-tests and chi-square
tests were used, respectively. Linear regression, with functional disability as the
dependent variable, was conducted with
severity ofdepression, visual Impalrment,
number of medical conditions, number
of medications, age, and sex: as independent variables.

Procedure
Ageriatric nurse-practitioner with extensive experience in geriatric psychiatry
obtained Informed consent and then interviewed each patient, using a structured clinical format. Demographic,
medical, and ophthalmologic characteristics were recorded on standardized
326

RESULTS
Twenty-seven patients (38.6%) met DSMlll-R criteria for major depression. Of
these, 17 patients (63%) had GDS scores
of 11 or marc. Depressed patients did not
differ from nondepressed patients in age

Table 1 compares depressed with
nondepressed patients and shows that
the clinically depressed patients had significantly higher GDS scores (more severely depressed) and FAS scores (more
functionally disabled) than nondepressed patients, but did not differ in type
or number of eye diseases, severity or
duration of visual impairment, or other
medical characteristics.
Table 2 shows the results ofthe linear
regression analysis. It indicates that severity of depression was the strongest clinical variable associated with functioning
and that it explained 20% ofthe variance.

medical conditions did not add significantly to the prediction model.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to our knowledge to
assess the frequency and impact of depression in elderly patients with visual
impairment attending a low-vision clinic.
We found that over one-third of patients
had high levels ofdepression and that this
rate was higher than those found in other
studies DC medically ill, elderly outpatients. I 6-18 Sartorius et at.)6 reported that
approximately 20% ofgeneral health care

Depression and Low Vision

among aldermen in a primary care setting
was 10%. Callahan et at 18 reponed a
prevalence of 17.1 % for significant symptoms of depression among a cohort of
elderly patients in a primary care setting.
Allbaugh our data demonstrate that
the rate and impaa ofdepression are substantial in this population, the results must
be interpreted cautiously. The studysample
cannot be considered representative of all
patients with low vision because the patients were referred to a low-vision clinic by
diJfcrent ophthalmologists who might vary
in the criteria they used for referral. In such
a setting, patients with two conditions, including depression, or more severe conditions, may be more likely to be referred.
Second, the mental status examinations
were conducted by a geriatric nurse-pracntioner and not by board-certified geriatric
psychiatrists. However, the assessments
had a high degree of reliability and validi~
the latter indicated by the association of
depression diagnoses with other clinical
variables. Third, because the data were
cross-sectional, they do not permit inferences to be drawn about the direction of
causality between functional impainncnt
and depression. Fourth, the functional
measure we used was not developed specifically Cor assessment of functional impainnent caused by poor vision. Future
studies might include such a measure. 19
How can we understand such high
rates of depression in these visually impaired patients? For one, depression was
independent of severity of visual impair.
ment, This suggests that other factors,
such as the personal meaning or impact
of visual or functional impairment on patients' lives, premorbid personality traits,

or coping styles are operative. However,
the depressed patients were not more
likely to have had past psychiatric treatment (which would have suggested that
they were predisposed to depression). It
seems most likely that visual impairments
are experienced profoundly by some individuals, given the Importance of both
vision and independent functioning in
our society.
We found that depressed patients
were more disabled in ADts than nondepressed patients, regardless of the severityoftheirvisual impainnent. Depression
may have rendered these patients apathetic or disinterested in their selfcare-or their functional limitations
(related to medical or ophthalmologic
conditions) made them depressed. When
we examined proxy indicators of medical
severity (number of medical conditions
and medications). we found that depression was a more powerful predictor of
functional disability than these measures.
Number of medications may have been
associated with functional impairment on
the basis of their side effects. However,
otherstudies have confinned that depression adversely affects functioning independently ofthe severity of other medical
20
problems.
Aging of the population and the increasing prevalence of chronic disabling
medical, neurological, and ophthalmic
disorders have made caring for elderly
patients a major focus of health care. Because many of these disorders lack curative treatments, identifying potentially
treatable conditions such as depression is
especially important. Physicians often
have limited training in psychiatric diag-

be less responsive to psychosocial topics

finding is unfortunate because untreated

persist and is associated with higher mortality rates.l Z

Increased recognition of depression
in visually impaired older persons offers
the opponunity to identify high-risk individuals and possibly improve their mood
and functional abilities. The results of this
study indicate the Importance of depression in these patients and their need for
evaluation, referral, and treatment,
