Abstract
Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are direction-specific acoustic filters formed by the head, the pinnae and the ear canals.
They can be used to assess acoustical cues available for sound localization and to construct virtual auditory environments. We
measured the HRTFs of three anesthetized Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from 591 locations in the frontal hemisphere ranging
from 390³ (left) to 90³ (right) in azimuth and 360³ (down) to 90³ (up) in elevation for frequencies between 0.5 and 15 kHz. Acoustic
validation of the HRTFs shows good agreement between free field and virtual sound sources. Monaural spectra exhibit deep notches
at frequencies above 9 kHz, providing putative cues for elevation discrimination. Interaural level differences (ILDs) and interaural
time differences (ITDs) generally vary monotonically with azimuth between 0.5 and 8 kHz, suggesting that these two cues can be
used to discriminate azimuthal position. Comparison with published subsets of HRTFs from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus)
shows good agreement. Comparison with published human HRTFs from the frontal hemisphere demonstrates overall similarity in
the patterns of ILD and ITD, suggesting that the Rhesus monkey is a good acoustic model for these two sound localization cues in
humans. Finally, the measured ITDs in the horizontal plane agree well between 340³ and 40³ in azimuth with those calculated from
a spherical head model with a radius of 52 mm, one-half the interaural distance of the monkey. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

1. Introduction
Macaque monkeys have long been recognized as signi¢cant animal models of human perception and cognition, including auditory function. Work on auditory
processing in several species of macaque includes studies of hearing loss (He¡ner and He¡ner, 1986), behavior and neurophysiology of sound localization (Jay and
Sparks, 1987 ; Jay and Sparks, 1984; He¡ner, 1997 ;
He¡ner and He¡ner, 1990; Houben and Gourevitch,
1979 ; Brown et al., 1980; Brown et al., 1978), attentional/intentional auditory processing (Hocherman et
al., 1976 ; Stricanne et al., 1996; Mazzoni et al., 1996)
and processing of complex sounds (Rauschecker, 1998 ;

Rauschecker, 1997; Rauschecker et al., 1997). Despite
this interest in the auditory function of macaques, there
are no extensive descriptions of the auditory cues available to these important models of human auditory
function. The work presented here attempts to ¢ll this
lacuna by presenting a detailed description of the headrelated transfer functions (HRTFs) of the Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). HRTFs are direction-speci¢c
acoustic ¢lters formed by the head, the pinnae and
the ear canals. They can be used to assess available
acoustic cues for sound localization and to construct
virtual auditory environments that can be used in psychophysical and/or neurophysiological experiments.
Several measurements of human HRTFs have been reported (Shaw and Teranishi, 1968 ; Middlebrooks et al.,
1989 ; Wightman and Kistler, 1989), but no comparison
with those of the Rhesus monkey has yet been made.
Herein we report HRTFs from three female adult Rhesus monkeys from 591 locations in the frontal hemisphere. Results from an initial stage of this work have
been published in abstract form (Keller et al., 1998b).

2. Materials and methods
Three adult female Rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta),
aged 17^20 years and weighing 6^7 kg, were used in
this study. Positive castings of an anesthetized monkey's external auditory meatus were made by ¢lling
the ears with an ear mold compound (A-Zilicone, Oticon) that could be removed for further analysis once it
solidi¢ed.
The method of measuring HRTFs with broadband
noise bursts, described here, is based on methods used
in the measurement of human HRTFs by Mellert and
colleagues (Mellert et al., 1974; Mehrgardt and Mellert,
1977), by Wightman and Kistler (1989) and by Blauert
and colleagues (Blauert, 1997). Our results also should
be comparable to similar work done with cats (Musicant et al., 1990 ; Brugge et al., 1994), guinea pigs (Hartung and Sterbing, 1997) and barn owls (Keller et al.,
1998a). All procedures involving monkeys were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Oregon, in compliance with
the Animal Welfare Act and other pertinent regulations
under the US Public Health Service.
A monkey was premedicated with atropine (0.3 mg,
IM) to reduce £uid production 10^15 min prior to anesthetization with ketamine (100 mg, IM) and diazepam
(5 mg, IM). The anesthetized monkey was placed on a
surgical table over a hot water blanket and maintained
on 1^2% iso£urane (v/v) in O2 via mask, as needed.
Anesthesia prevents the normal equilibration of middle
ear pressure by inactivating the Eustachian tubes in
birds (Keller et al., 1998a ; Larsen and Dooling, 1996)
and ferrets (Carlile, 1990a,b). Preliminary studies
showed this to be the case in the monkey as well, and
thus small incisions in the tympanum of each ear were
necessary to allow equilibration of middle ear pressure
during the HRTF measurements. In our initial experiments, we made the incisions after the monkey was
positioned in the anechoic chamber used for HRTF
measurements, so that we could compare HRTFs recorded before and after incision. After we determined
that the e¡ect of incision was non-directional (Section
3.2), incisions were made prior to transferring the monkey to the anechoic chamber. To make the incisions,
each ear canal was ¢rst cleaned with a cotton swab.
To facilitate visualization of the tympanum during incision, a piece of cellophane (18 mmU10 mm) was
rolled into a cylinder and inserted into the ear canal.
This kept the hairs lining the ear canal from obstructing
the view of the tympanum. A small incision was then
made in the upper anterior region, an area visualized
with the aid of a dissecting microscope and a pediatric
otospeculum. Monkeys responded normally to auditory
stimuli within 48 h of completion of the entire procedure.

Once incisions were made, an intravenous drip of
lactated Ringer's solution or 5% dextrose solution was
begun, the monkey was given additional ketamine (50
mg, IM) and diazepam (2.5 mg, IM), taken o¡ iso£urane and transferred to the anechoic chamber. Before
being placed in the anechoic chamber, the monkey
was intubated tracheally using standard procedures
and given 1% iso£urane (v/v) in O2 . When the HRTF
measurements were underway, the iso£urane was reduced to 0.7^0.9% iso£urane (v/v) in O2 . The monkey
was positioned in the anechoic chamber such that the
intersection of the interaural axis and the midline was
in the center of an imaginary sphere formed by the
positions of the speaker in the experiment (Fig. 1A).
Laser beams directed from directly above (90³ elevation) and in front (0³ azimuth, 0³ elevation) of the
monkey allowed accurate positioning of the head. The
lasers from above and in front formed spots on top of
the monkey's head and above the monkey's nose, respectively, with the intersection occurring near to the
center of the interaural axis. The monkey's head was
held in place by a socket attached to its cranium using
dental cement, as previously described (Marrocco et al.,
1987). The intubation tube always extended from the
right side of the mouth. Both the tube and the headpost
were acoustically padded during the experiment. A patient monitor was used to record heart rate, blood oxygen saturation level, respiration rate and temperature.
During the experiment, atropine (0.05 mg/kg, IV) or
glycopyrrolate (0.06 mg, IV) was given as needed to
counteract £uid production.
Monkeys are known to move their pinnae in response
to sound (Jay and Sparks, 1987) and it is also known
that pinna position and shape modulate HRTFs in cats
and humans (Populin and Yin, 1998 ; Hofman et al.,
1998). The pinnae in this study were not mechanically
¢xed, but they did not move throughout a recording
session. They took a relaxed position in which the angle
between the line de¢ned by the superior portion of the
helix (Middlebrooks, 1999a) and the midline was between 0³ and 10³ and the angle between the line de¢ned
by the superior portion of the helix and the interaural
axis was between 80³ and 90³.
Digital signals were converted to analog form and
transduced by a 3.5 inch loudspeaker (Eclipse 8232)
that could be moved in elevation along a C-shaped
hoop (radius = 90 cm) subtending 180³ of vertical arc
(Fig. 1A). The hoop could be rotated in azimuth
through 180³. This allowed presentation of sounds at
nearly any location in the frontal hemisphere. Loudspeaker position was accurate to þ 0.5³ in elevation
and in azimuth.
The sounds used to measure the HRTFs were digitally generated in the frequency domain (Tucker Davis
Technologies (TDT) AP2) and consisted of repeated, 46

ms noise bursts with a £at amplitude spectrum and
random phase spectrum between 0.5 and 22.5 kHz.
These sounds were transformed to the time domain,
converted to an analog voltage (90 000 samples per second, TDT PD1), attenuated (TDT PA4), ampli¢ed
(TDT HB6) and transduced by an Eclipse 8232 loudspeaker. The transduced signals measured 77 dB SPL at
the position of the monkey's head (A-weighted, peak
amplitude, Bruel and Kjaer 2235 SPL meter, micro«
phone model 4176) and retained a relatively £at magnitude spectrum of þ 10 dB between 1 and 20 kHz.
For sound measurements in the ear canal, we used
miniature Knowles microphones (EM4046) ¢tted with a
3.2 cm long probe tube (Clay Adams PE160, ID
1.14 mm, OD 1.57 mm) inserted into the ear canal to
within 8 mm of the ear drum. Microphone signals were
preampli¢ed through a custom-built, phase-compensated ampli¢er, converted to digital form (oversampled
at 90 000 samples per second to avoid aliasing, TDT
PD1) and averaged in synchrony with the repeated
noise bursts (n = 100). The FFT of the digitized microphone output was divided by the FFT of the digitized
input sound to yield the recorded raw data.
Data collection involved recording a catalogue of left
and right microphone signals for 591 locations across
the frontal hemisphere from 360³ (down) to 90³ (up) in
elevation and 390³ (left) to 90³ (right) in azimuth, at a
resolution of 5³ in double polar coordinates. Data processing to yield HRTFs involved the following digital
processing steps in MATLAB (versions 5.2 and 5.3):
(1) Each raw data spectrum was transformed into the
time domain using the inverse fast Fourier transform.
(2) The energy was calculated within a 250-point rectangular window as it was translated across the 1024point raw impulse response. This allowed identi¢cation
of the earliest point at which the energy reached a maximum for each impulse response. All impulse responses

75

were shifted toward t = 0 by the shortest latency detected in the full catalogue by this method. Each impulse response was then truncated to 250 points following its point of maximal energy (to remove re£ections
and noise) and then padded with zeros (Proakis and
Manolakis, 1996, pp. 400^401) to 512 points.
(3) For analysis of the HRTFs, we removed the ¢ltering e¡ects of the loudspeaker and microphones-withprobe-tubes. The loudspeaker to microphone transfer
functions were measured with the microphones at the
center of the hoop without the monkey present, where
the head normally is during HRTF measurements. The
transfer function for either the left or right microphone
was removed by convolution of the impulse response
with an FIR least-squares inverse ¢lter (Proakis and
Manolakis, 1996) constructed to pass the inverse of
that transfer function. The resulting 512-point inverse
¢lters showed a nearly linear phase change with frequency. The impulse response of each inverse ¢lter
was checked for su¤ciency by convolution with the
impulse response that it was intended to remove. The
resultant error in the frequency domain was typically
less than þ 0.1 dB between 1 and 15 kHz.
To con¢rm the acoustical validity of the HRTFs, we
presented HRTF-¢ltered signals via Etymotic ER-1 earphones placed into the outer part of the ear canals and
compared these with signals presented in the `free ¢eld'.
For sound presentation by earphones, we removed successively from the recorded HRTFs ¢rst the e¡ects of
the transfer function of the loudspeaker, and then the
e¡ects of the transfer function of the earphone-ear canal-microphone. The transfer function of the loudspeaker was measured with a Bru and Kjaer 2235
«el
sound level meter (microphone model 4176) placed
1 cm from the loudspeaker. The transfer function of
the earphone-ear canal-microphone was measured
with the microphones in place in the ear canal. During

analysis, sounds presented in the free ¢eld were convolved with an inverse ¢lter to remove the loudspeaker-microphone transfer function. Each inverse ¢lter was constructed, tested and applied as above (step
3). However, during playback, we used a sampling rate
of 30 kHz because our hardware was incapable of processing the very long head-related impulse responses
(HRIRs, time domain forms of the HRTFs) generated
at a 90 kHz sampling rate. To do this, we resampled the
90 kHz HRIRs at 30 kHz and used these for on-line
digital signal processing (TDT PD1).
(4) Proper unwrapping of phase across frequency and
space for visualization of interaural time di¡erences
(ITDs) required further zero-padding (Proakis and
Manolakis, 1996, pp. 400^401) the 512-point HRIRs
to allow a 2048-point FFT.
Each ¢nal catalogue consisted of 590 or 591 left/right
pairs of 512-point HRIRs. To assess the variability of
the data in this study, we will often use the nine standard speaker locations shown from the monkey's point
of view, in double polar coordinates in Fig. 1B.
3. Results
3.1. The ear canal
The ear canal of the Rhesus monkey is a long and
narrow structure extending approximately 20 mm from
its entrance to the most distal portion of the tympanum. The canal begins as a larger tube (4.5 mmU
3 mmU5 mm long; Fig. 2B) that narrows to a tube
with an inner diameter of approximately 3 mm (Fig.
2C). This transition is marked by a bend of approximately 15³ (Fig. 2F), and the tube extends for 13^15
mm to a £atter region (3.5 mmU2 mm ; Fig. 2E) bor-

3.1 for other details.

dering the tympanum. The tympanum itself (Fig. 2D) is
6 mm in diameter with a central umbo of 1 mm diameter.
The probe tubes (3.2 cm long) on the Knowles microphones were always positioned so that less than 2 cm
remained outside the ear canal. Thus, the end of a
probe tube was never more than 8 mm from the distal
edge of the tympanum. The location of the probe tubes
is important because the sound pressure inside the ear
canal is not uniform. Sound pressure waves at wavelengths less than or equal to 1/4 the length of the ear
canal generate standing waves within the ear canal
(Blauert, 1997, pp. 65^70, Teranishi and Shaw, 1968).
The sound pressure measured by the probe tube, in
addition to being modulated by the location of the
sound source, will be a¡ected by the tube's position
with respect to the standing waves. This complicates
comparisons between datasets since our precision in
probe tube placement between experiments is þ 1 mm.
To eliminate e¡ects of probe tube position due to these
standing waves and to facilitate comparisons between
datasets, we use directional transfer functions (DTFs)
in our comparisons (Middlebrooks and Green, 1990). A
set of DTFs is computed from a set of HRTFs by
subtracting the RMS log magnitude spectrum across
all locations from one ear from the log magnitude spectra of all locations from that same ear.
3.2. Tympanum incision
In an anesthetized animal, failure of the middle
ear pressure to equilibrate with ambient air pressure
dynamically changes the shape of the tympanum
and results in concomitant dynamic changes in the
HRTFs (Keller et al., 1998a ; Carlile, 1990a,b). To
estimate the magnitude of these changes in the anesthetized monkey, we computed the spectral di¡erences
between HRTFs measured 5^6 h apart (i.e.
HRTFend of run 3HRTFbeginning of run ) for each of the
nine standard locations (Fig. 1B). During these measurements, neither the monkeys nor the microphones
were moved, but we observed spectral di¡erences as
large as þ 5 dB between 1.5 and 10 kHz over the course
of our measurements (Fig. 3A). These spectral di¡erences were consistent across the nine locations and thus
we considered that they could be due to changes in the
pressure di¡erence across the tympanum.
HRTF measurements taken after making small incisions in the tympanum support this hypothesis, as seen
in Fig. 3B. Here, we show di¡erence spectra computed
from measurements taken after the tympanum incision
and again 5^6 h later at the end of a recording session.
It is clear that the HRTFs are quite stable if the middle
ear is vented via tympanum incision. The ¢gure also
shows that magnitude di¡erences of þ 1 dB can be ex-

3.3. Acoustical validation

Fig. 3. Di¡erence spectra show the requirement and e¡ects of tympanum incision. A: Di¡erence spectra between measurements 5^6 h
apart in the absence of tympanum incisions, measured at each of
the nine standard locations (Fig. 1B) for monkey 2. B: Di¡erence

pected over the course of our measurements. The large
di¡erences seen at higher frequencies are due to the
misalignment of deep spectral notches (Section 4.1)
whose presence was independent of tympanum incision.
This misalignment is caused by small di¡erences in
speaker position during repeated measurements and is
not related to the presence or absence of the tympanum
incisions.
Tympanum incisions lead to changes in middle ear
pressure that modify HRTFs in a similar manner as
seen in Fig. 3A. Di¡erence spectra for the nine locations taken before and after the tympanum incision (i.e.
HRTFafter incision 3HRTFbefore incision ), hence 30^60 min
apart, are shown in Fig. 3C. At the time of the incision,
the monkey had typically been receiving iso£urane
anesthesia for 30^60 min, likely resulting in a pressure
imbalance between the middle ear and ear canal. Fig.
3C shows that the tympanum incision resulted in a
substantial non-directional change in HRTFs that we
attribute to the equilibration of these two pressures.

The use of virtual auditory space in experimental
approaches assumes that the virtual sound sources employed are reliable models of their corresponding free
¢eld stimuli. This assumption was tested by comparing
broadband noise bursts presented from the free ¢eld
with those delivered over earphones using the corresponding measured and processed HRIRs. We used
miniature Knowles microphones to record these sound
pairs inside the ear canal. All HRIRs were corrected for
the transfer functions of the speaker, microphones and
ear canals, as described in Section 2. Microphone position was held constant throughout the measurement
(n.b. see below). Di¡erence spectra for both the magnitude and phase of the free ¢eld minus the virtual ¢eld
were computed for each of the nine standard locations.
One-third-octave band smoothing was applied to each
magnitude spectrum before di¡erence spectra were calculated. The 1/3-octave window approximates the critical band of humans (Hartmann, 1998, pp. 249^250)
and Rhesus monkeys (Gourevitch, 1970).
Between 1 and 9 kHz, the free ¢eld and virtual magnitude spectra are almost identical at each of the nine
standard locations. Fig. 4 plots the di¡erence spectra
(i.e. free ¢eld3virtual) and shows the close correspondence of the traces from each of the nine locations.
Deviations from 0 dB in Fig. 4 are small and consistent
across speaker locations. The markedly directional differences above 9 kHz could be due to misalignments of
deep spectral notches caused by slight di¡erences in
loudspeaker position or by shifts in microphone posi-

tion due to insertion of the earphones. The small size of
the ear canals (ID = 3 mm) made these measurements
challenging, and it was not possible to avoid contact
between earphone and microphone tubes. The results
shown in Fig. 4 are typical for both monkeys 1 and 2
(HRIRs from monkey 3 were not tested for validity).
3.4. HRTF structure-monaural spectra, interaural level
di¡erence (ILD), ITD
HRTFs allow for the evaluation of prominent acoustical cues for sound localization. Monaural cues for
sound localization are location-dependent di¡erences
in the transformation of magnitudes of an incident
auditory signal in one ear. These di¡erences can be
seen by plotting monaural spectra, the spatial dependence of gain at a number of speci¢ed frequencies
(i.e. monaural gain functions), and the frequency dependence of the location of maximal gain (i.e. the
acoustic axis). Binaural cues for sound localization are
interaural di¡erences in the transformation of magnitudes ILDs) and in the time of arrival (ITDs) of an
incident auditory signal. This section presents our
data regarding both monaural and binaural cues for
sound localization in the monkey.
Monaural spectra are especially useful for showing
how the shape of the outer ear and ear canal transforms
the magnitudes of incident auditory signals in an elevation-dependent manner. Monaural spectra of monkey 2

The scale bar shown (bottom middle) is 40 dB.

Second, the mean di¡erence between the minimal gain and the gains

was required to be v10 dB. A: Monkey 2, showing that in this subject the notch center frequency tended to increase with increasing elevation. B: Monkey 1, showing that the notch center frequency
does not vary systematically with elevation for this subject. Data
for both right (b) and left (R) ears are plotted.

tions ranging from 360³ to 90³ are shown in Fig. 5.
Signi¢cant elevation-dependent spectral di¡erences can
be seen at frequencies above 8 kHz, and these di¡erences are most evident in the placement of deep spectral
notches, occurring most often at frequencies above
10 kHz. We also see this prevalence of notches in monaural spectra of monkey 3, while we observe fewer
notches in monaural spectra of monkey 1. In spectra
of both monkeys 2 and 3, these notches increase in
center frequency from about 8 kHz at low elevations
to about 15 kHz at the highest elevations, for locations
þ 20³ in azimuth. This dependence of notch center frequency on elevation is shown for monkey 2 in Fig. 6A.
Here, frequencies needed to satisfy two criteria in order
to be considered notch center frequencies. First, a frequency was required to be the point of minimal gain in
a monaural spectrum. Second, the mean di¡erence between the minimal gain and the gains at frequencies
88 Hz to either side of the putatively identi¢ed notch
was required to be v10 dB. Fig. 6B shows that for
monaural spectra of monkey 1, where notches are less
prevalent, there is not a strong elevational dependence
of notch center frequency.
We cannot unambiguously identify the sources of the
notches in our monaural spectra. Notches similar to
those we observe can be caused by re£ections from

the pinnae (Populin and Yin, 1998) and by re£ective
surfaces on experimental apparatus. However, if our
experimental apparatus was responsible for the notches
we observe, we would expect to see a similar pattern of
notches across animals, which we did not. This suggests
that individual features of the head and pinnae could in
fact be responsible for the observed notches. Although
we cannot rule out the possibility that the di¡erences
are due to di¡erences in cranial headpost implants,
these were well-padded in our experiments with acoustically absorbent material.
The presence of notches in monaural spectra requires
that qualitative comparisons to assess similarity between datasets are restricted to frequencies below 10
kHz. This is due to the fact that the position of a notch
on the frequency axis is highly sensitive to speaker position. For example, for the barn owl, a notch's center
frequency can shift by as much as 150 Hz per degree of
change in speaker position (Keller et al., 1998a). In our
experiments, speaker position was accurate to þ 0.5³
while head placement was accurate to within 2³. Both
sources of error when combined yield fairly large magnitude di¡erences across similar trials in the frequency
range where notches occur (ca. 9^15 kHz), presumably
due to changes in notch center frequency caused by
small changes in speaker and/or head position.
Monaural gain functions show how space is acoustically structured at individual frequencies by the shape
of the outer ear and ear canal. Monaural gain functions
for monkey 2 are shown in Fig. 7, and they are representative of all three monkeys. Each diamond plot
shows elevation (360³ to 90³) on the ordinate and azimuth (390³ to 90³) on the abscissa, in double polar
coordinates. Colors correspond to the gain on a dB
scale, with reddish and bluish colors indicating positive
and negative gain, respectively. These gain functions are
plotted for the unsmoothed DTFs. At frequencies between 0.5^10 kHz, there is a nearly monotonic increase
in gain as source position moves ipsilaterally. At higher
frequencies, a more localized structure is observed, a
result of the monaural spectral notches.
The acoustic axis is de¢ned for each frequency as the
direction of maximal gain for that particular frequency.
Acoustic axes were calculated from 1/3-octave bandwidth-smoothed DTFs. Results are shown for monkey
2, and are typical of the monkeys used in this study. As
shown in Fig. 8A, the frequency-dependent shifts in the
azimuth of the acoustic axes for the left and right ears
are roughly symmetrical across the midline. There is a

gain from 0.5 to 3 kHz. This shift levels out at 330³^

right, respectively, for frequencies between 3 and 8

occurs, and the acoustic axes are fairly stable at about

downward and a slow progression back up toward horizontal as the frequency nears 15 kHz. The large shift in
the elevation of the acoustic axis observed in both ears
at about 10 kHz is due to the pattern of notches. In the
absence of the notches, the gain functions exhibit a
broad region of space that is within þ 1 dB of maximal
gain (e.g. Fig. 7, 7998 Hz). This region is bifurcated and
then further disrupted by the notches at higher frequencies (e.g. Fig. 7, 9976 Hz).
Plots of ILDs calculated from the unsmoothed DTFs
of monkeys 1 and 2 (two measurements on two di¡erent days for monkey 2) are shown in Fig. 9. As with the
monaural gain functions, these plots have elevation on
the ordinate and azimuth on the abscissa, and the colors correspond to the magnitude of level di¡erence
(right ear3left ear) for each measured location, on a
dB scale. Positive and negative ILDs result from auditory signals that are at a higher level in the right ear
and left ear, respectively. Comparison of the left and
center columns in Fig. 9 shows that there is good reproducibility between measurements in a single monkey, both in overall spatial pattern and in absolute
ILDs. The RMS di¡erence between the two measurements for monkey 2 is less than 6 dB for frequencies
between 1 and 10 kHz over all 591 locations. This variability is not markedly a¡ected by quadrant, nor does
it increase the farther a sound source moves from center
(0³,0³). These RMS di¡erences in ILD are 2-fold higher
between monkeys over the same frequency and location
range.
ITD plots (Fig. 10) are shown in the same format as
were the plots for the monaural gain functions and the
ILDs. Colors on this plot indicate the di¡erence in arrival times (in Ws) for the sound at the right and left
ears. Positive and negative values indicate that the
sound is leading in the right ear and the left ear, respectively. ITDs are minimal near the midline and vary
monotonically with azimuth and are very similar across
measurements within the same monkey and between
monkeys. The maximal ITD averaged across frequencies from datasets from monkeys 1^3 was 473 þ 7 Ws,
corresponding to about 5.3 Ws/³ azimuth.
4. Discussion
4.1. Variability due to the notches at high frequency
Our objectives in measuring HRTFs of the Rhesus
monkey were to gain an understanding of the acoustic
cues available to the monkey for sound localization and
to develop the technology for the simulation of free
¢eld auditory sources during psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments. Both of these objectives require replicability across measurements in the same an-

di¡erences. Each plot shows the standard deviation of di¡erences in
DTF magnitude between monkey 2 and another monkey, after the
frequencies of the monaural gain function of monkey 2 have been
scaled up or down relative those of the other monkey. Ratios of frequencies (i.e. frequency scaling factor) are plotted on the abscissa.
To achieve better overall agreement of DTF spectra, those for monkey 2 would be scaled upward in frequency to match those of monkey 1 (dashed line), and downward in frequency to match those of
monkey 3 (solid line). See text for more details.

imal and some level of agreement across measurements
between animals. Repeated monaural measurements at
the nine standard locations within the same monkey
varied in magnitude by only þ 2.5 dB except at frequencies occupied by the spectral notches. Measurements
between monkeys showed greater variability. However,
our intersubject di¡erences were similar to those seen
for human HRTFs (Middlebrooks et al., 1989).
We examined the variability between monkeys by
applying the method of frequency scaling (Middlebrooks et al., 1989; Middlebrooks, 1999a). The scaling
factor expands or contracts one subject's DTF magnitude spectra along the frequency axis relative to those
of a reference subject to obtain a better agreement between the two sets of DTFs. Middlebrooks and coworkers found that such scaling can reduce variability
between DTFs from human subjects and can improve
subjects' virtual localization when using non-individualized DTFs (Middlebrooks, 1999b). They also showed
that the scaling factor correlated most highly with maximum ITD, head width and pinna cavity height (Middlebrooks, 1999a). In general, DTFs of larger subjects (i.e. larger ITD) needed to be scaled upward
in frequency to enhance agreement with DTFs of
smaller subjects (i.e. smaller ITD) (Middlebrooks,
1999a).
In the following analysis, monkey 2 served as the
reference subject and we calculated the level di¡erences
between monkey 2 and monkeys 1 and 3, respectively,

HEARES 3434 12-5-00 Cyaan Magenta Geel Zwart

84

for a given frequency at each of 590 locations. We
followed Middlebrooks et al. (1989) in using the standard deviation of DTF di¡erences as a measure of intersubject variability. We used eight reference frequencies and corresponding variable test frequencies. We
subtracted the DTF magnitudes for monkey 2 at the
speci¢ed reference frequencies (2^10 kHz, 1 kHz increments) from those of monkeys 1 and 3 at variable
frequencies 0.5^1.5 times the reference frequency (in
22 Hz increments, for 590 locations). We then calculated the standard deviation of the di¡erence distribution across all locations for each variable frequency.
Minimal standard deviations occurring at a ratio (variable frequency :reference frequency) of one indicate
that no frequency shift is necessary. We found that
the frequency ratios (using monkey 2 as the reference
subject) that gave minimal standard deviation for both
ears for all locations at the eight reference frequencies
were 1.05 and 0.98 for monkeys 1 and 3, respectively
(Fig. 11). Thus, DTFs of monkey 2 would need to be
scaled slightly higher to optimally match those of monkey 1 and slightly lower to optimally match those of
monkey 3. Interestingly, the maximal ITD for monkey
2 (474 ms) falls between a lower value for monkey 1
(464 ms) and a higher value for monkey 3 (479 ms), so
our analysis is consistent with Middlebrooks' (1999a)
observation for human subjects. Repeating the analysis
using RMS di¡erences between subjects, following Middlebrooks (1999a), resulted in the same pattern of scale
factor and maximal ITD for the three monkeys. Signi¢cantly, the ranges of the standard deviations for our
data agree well with the ranges reported by Middlebrooks et al. (1989) for six human subjects across 356 locations. Ours are slightly more variable at 10 kHz, presumably due to notches in the data from 9 to 15 kHz
(Fig. 5 and see discussion below).
Sources of variability in measuring HRTFs from a
single monkey include di¡erences in the positions of
the speaker, pinnae and head. Variability in measuring
HRTFs from two di¡erent monkeys includes these
sources as well as morphological di¡erences. In the frequency domain, the largest variability in gain is in the

9^15 kHz range. As previously discussed (Fig. 5), this is
due to the spectral notches that vary in frequency by
location and to the fact that speaker position is only
accurate to þ 0.5³ while head position is only accurate
to within 2³.
To determine how much of the variability across
measurements could be attributed to the spectral
notches, we compared spectra obtained in several conditions at each of the nine standard locations. To this
end, we compared the di¡erences between each condition using unsmoothed and 1/3-octave level-smoothed
spectra. By con¢ning the analysis to the frequency
range where the notches are most pervasive (i.e. 9^15
kHz), we can attribute a reduction in variability of the
smoothed spectra as being due to the elimination of the
notches.
As a ¢rst step, we normalized the gain for each recording session by subtracting the log magnitudes of
the HRTFs obtained at (0³,0³) from those at each of
the other eight standard locations, within a single condition. For the smoothing condition, we smoothed the
resulting normalized HRTFs between 0 and 20 kHz and
analyzed the frequency band between 9 and 15 kHz.
For example, to compare recordings from monkey 1
and monkey 2.1, we calculated a di¡erence spectrum
for each of the eight locations using either the unsmoothed or smoothed data. The RMS di¡erence
across frequencies was calculated for each di¡erence
spectrum and these values were averaged across the
eight locations to give an estimate of mean variability
between sets of normalized HRTFs.
Table 1 shows the three conditions of comparison in
three separate columns. The ¢rst column compares two
measurements of the nine locations from monkey 2 in
the same session, where the ¢rst measurement was taken at the beginning of the session and the second measurement was taken at the end of the session, after
collecting data for all 591 locations. In this case, the
measurements were separated by about 5^6 h. The second column of Table 1 compares two measurements of
the nine locations from monkey 2, carried out on two
di¡erent days. The third column of Table 1 compares

measurements from monkey 1 with those from monkey
2, taken on separate days.
From the data in Table 1, it is apparent that the
HRTFs from the right ear are slightly more variable
than those from the left, consistent with the observation
that the notches are more prevalent in the right ear
(Fig. 5). Our data indicate that variability within and
between datasets from the same monkey (Table 1, columns 1 and 2) and between di¡erent monkeys (Table 1,
column 3) can be largely explained by the spectral
notches (i.e. the RMS di¡erences are signi¢cantly reduced by 1/3-octave bandwidth smoothing). After
smoothing, the within monkey RMS di¡erences range
from 1 to 2 dB, while those between monkeys decrease
from about 10 dB to 3^5 dB. This analysis suggests that
smoothing will facilitate the use of non-individualized
HRTFs in neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments that require frequencies above 9 kHz, for
locations within about 30³ of straight ahead.
4.2. Comparison with HRTFs from squirrel monkeys and
humans
The only other published HRTF-like data from monkeys were reported by Harrison and Downey (1970) for
the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Their data cover
the horizontal plane in 15³ increments for tones of 4, 10
and 20 kHz (Harrison and Downey, 1970). Plots of
ILD vs. azimuth using these data are similar to our
own ILD data at identical frequencies, except that we
observe 10^50% greater maximal ILDs compared to
Harrison and Downey. The di¡erence between our
data and those of Harrison and Downey is most signi¢cant for the 4 kHz condition. Whereas the plot of
ILD vs. azimuth at 4 kHz for the squirrel monkey is
relatively £at ( þ 2^3 dB) and does not follow the plots
at 10 and 20 kHz, the corresponding 4 kHz plot for the
Rhesus monkey peaks at dILDd s 10 dB and follows the
plots at the higher frequencies (not shown). These differences could be due to dissimilar shadowing caused by
di¡erences in head size between the two species. However, unlike our recordings from within the ear canal,
Harrison and Downey recorded the transformed signal
external to the ear canal. Thus, the di¡erences between
the two measurements could be merely the result of
di¡erences in microphone position.
Due to the importance of the Rhesus monkey as a
human model in auditory research, we compared interaural level and time di¡erences from our data with
those present in the human HRTF catalogue measured
by Wightman and Kistler, from subject SOS, that is
supplied with the Tucker Davis Technologies' Sound
Stage0 software (Wightman and Kistler, 1989). A representative comparison of ILDs at several frequencies is
shown in Fig. 12. Data for monkey 2 (replotted from

clear transition in the data occurs between 1 and 2 kHz.

abscissa and elevations ranging between 350³ and 90³
on the ordinate. Colors indicate the magnitude of the
ILDs, calculated from DTFs, on a dB scale according
to the accompanying colorbars. Note that the color
scales used for the monkey and human data are di¡er-

ent in order to emphasize the clear similarity in overall
ILD pattern. In both species, absolute ILD generally
increases as distance from the midline increases. In
the comparison near 10 kHz, the contour of 0 dB
ILD (shown in magenta) is notably similar for elevations between 315³ and 330³, and there are similar
local minima and maxima for the comparisons near
4 and 8 kHz. Not surprisingly, the corresponding ITD
plots for this same comparison look very similar (not
shown), both demonstrating a monotonic increase in
MITDM as the distance from the midline increases. The
di¡erence in head size between Rhesus monkeys and
humans, however, leads to a maximal MITDM of V470
Ws and V700 Ws, respectively.
4.3. Comparisons of measured ITDs with models of ITD
dependence on azimuth
Several models are available that predict the dependence of ITD on azimuthal position based upon the size
of the head, and it is of interest to compare these predictions to our measured values. Woodworth (1938)
modeled the head as a sphere and calculated the ITD
resulting from the interaural path di¡erence as follows:
ITDrY a   raca  sina 

1

where r is the head radius, a is the angle of incidence of
the wavefront with the median plane and c is the speed
of sound (Woodworth, 1938). An empirically based
model of azimuthal variation of ITD in humans was
developed by Kuhn (1977). This model takes into account that ITD is also slightly dependent on frequency.
The model includes two functions of ITD, one for frequencies below 1250 Hz and the other for higher frequencies (Kuhn, 1977):
ITDrY a   3racsina Y f 91250 Hz

2

ITDrY a   2racsina Y f v1250 Hz

3

This model has been used to compare behavioral ITD
thresholds with localization thresholds of pure tones by
Rhesus monkeys on the assumption that Kuhn's human
model also describes ITD variation with location in the
Rhesus monkey (Houben and Gourevitch, 1979).
We compared our data with predictions from these
models, assuming a head radius of 52 mm, one-half the
interaural distance of monkey 2 (Fig. 13). It is clear
from the ¢gure that MITDM increases nearly monotonically as the sound source moves in azimuth away from
the center. In Fig. 13A, it is seen that Kuhn's low-frequency model (Eq. 2) describes this shift well for frequencies at or below 1000 Hz for positions ranging
between 390³ and 20³ in azimuth. For higher frequen-

87

cies and azimuths between 340³ and 40³, Woodworth's
model (Eq. 1) is in better agreement (Fig. 13B). Note
that a slightly better agreement with Woodworth's
model is obtained if we assume an e¡ective head radius
of 59 mm, appreciably larger than the value obtained
from the interaural distance.
