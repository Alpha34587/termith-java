Background. Identifying quantitative gait markers of falls in older adults may improve diagnostic assessments and
suggest novel intervention targets.
Methods. We studied 597 adults aged 70 and older (mean age 80.5 years, 62% women) enrolled in an aging study who
received quantitative gait assessments at baseline. Association of speed and six other gait markers (cadence, stride length,
swing, double support, stride length variability, and swing time variability) with incident fall rate was studied using generalized estimation equation procedures adjusted for age, sex, education, falls, chronic illnesses, medications, cognition,
disability as well as traditional clinical tests of gait and balance.
Results. Over a mean follow-up period of 20 months, 226 (38%) of the 597 participants fell. Mean fall rate was 0.44
per person-year. Slower gait speed (risk ratio [RR] per 10 cm/s decrease 1.069, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.001–
1.142) was associated with higher risk of falls in the fully adjusted models. Among six other markers, worse performance
on swing (RR 1.406, 95% CI 1.027–1.926), double-support phase (RR 1.165, 95% CI 1.026–1.321), swing time variability (RR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004–1.010), and stride length variability (RR 1.076, 95% CI 1.030–1.111) predicted fall risk.
The associations remained signiﬁcant even after accounting for cognitive impairment and disability.
Conclusions. Quantitative gait markers are independent predictors of falls in older adults. Gait speed and other
markers, especially variability, should be further studied to improve current fall risk assessments and to develop new
interventions.
Key Words: Gait—Falls.

O

NE third of community-residing adults older than 65
years fall each year (1). Falls result in major adverse
outcomes in older adults including injury, institutionalization, and death (2,3). The persistence of high rates of fall in
the elderly population despite the availability of many clinical risk assessments (4–6) and the modest success reported
with fall intervention trials (5,7) necessitates a better understanding of fall risk factors to develop simple and effective
screening tools as well as to identify new intervention
targets.
Gait training is a key component of fall prevention interventions (5,7), and gait evaluation is recommended in current fall guidelines (5,8). Yet, uniform clinical gait protocols
are lacking and diagnosis of gait abnormalities is highly
dependent on examiners’ expertise (9,10). Although there
are many performance-based mobility tests (5–7,11), they
may not be adopted in primary care settings as it takes time
and resources to use them accurately (12). Measuring gait
speed is suggested as a simple way to assess health and
function in older adults (5,6,13). Gait speed has been found
to be associated with risk of falls in few studies (14–18),
although most studies were limited by small sample size or
cross-sectional design (15,16), evaluation of a single sex
(17,19), and measurement of limited set of confounders
(5,9,18,20).

Gait is a complex motor phenomenon with many other
measurable facets besides speed that might identify fall risk.
We undertook this study to determine whether and to what
extent gait speed and other gait markers are independently
associated with risk of falls in a cohort of communityresiding adults aged 70 and older. Speciﬁcally, we compared
the predictive validity of individual gait variables as well as
gait domains for fall risk in older adults.

Methods

Study Population
We undertook a prospective cohort study nested within
the Einstein Aging Study (10). The primary aim of the Einstein Aging Study was to identify risk factors for dementia.
Study design has been previously reported (10,21). In brief,
potential participants (aged 70 and older) identiﬁed from
Bronx County population lists were contacted by letter explaining the purpose of the study and then by telephone.
Participants who gave verbal consent on the telephone were
invited for in-person evaluation at our research center. Exclusion criteria included severe audiovisual loss, bed bound
due to illness, and institutionalization. The study protocols
were approved by the local institutional review board, and
896

GAIT AND FALLS

written informed consents were obtained from each participant prior to enrollment. Participants returned at yearly
intervals.
Gait
Research assistants conducted quantitative gait studies
using a computerized walkway (180 × 35.5 × 0.25 inches)
with embedded pressure sensors (GAITRite; CIR Systems,
Havertown, PA) at study visits (21,22). Participants were
asked to walk on the mat at their “normal pace” for two trials in a quiet well-lit hallway wearing comfortable footwear
and without any attached monitors. Start and stop points
were marked by white lines on the ﬂoor and included 3 feet
from the walkway edge for initial acceleration and terminal
deceleration. Based on footfalls recorded on the walkway,
the software computes gait variables as the mean of two trials. Participants who could ambulate only with walking aids
were included, and the GAITRite data were manually edited by research assistants who were blinded to study aims.
The GAITRite system is widely used in clinical and research settings, and excellent reliability has been reported
in our and other centers (11,21–22).
Falls
Falls were deﬁned as the individual unintentionally coming down on the ﬂoor or to a lower level not due to a major
intrinsic or extrinsic event (7). Research assistants contacted
participants by telephone every 2–3 months in between
clinic visits to ascertain any new falls and associated injuries (laceration, fracture, or received emergency care). At
baseline and annual follow-up visits, participants were
asked about falls in the previous year.
This study began on September 2004 when we started
systematically ascertaining falls in our cohort. The ﬁrst telephone interview was administered in November 2004. Study
follow-up ended February 2008. Of the 827 Einstein Aging
study participants seen during this 42-month period, 101
had no fall assessments and 79 did not have gait assessments. Thus, 647 participants (78.2%) with gait and fall assessments were eligible. Among these participants, 50
(7.7%) had no follow-up fall assessments. Thus, 597 participants (92.7%) were included in the analysis. Participants
who were and were not included were similar in terms of
age, sex, and cognitive status. The 597 eligible participants
(100%) completed one or more follow-up telephone interviews, and 424 participants (71%) completed 1 year or more
follow-up.
Clinical Assessment
Clinical assistants used structured questionnaires to elicit
history of medical illnesses, medication use, and depressive
symptoms (21,23,24). Presence of depression, diabetes,
heart failure, hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction,

897

strokes, Parkinson’s disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and arthritis was used to calculate a summary illness
index (21,25). We consulted medical records and contacted
participants’ family members or physicians to verify or obtain further details. The following seven activities of daily
living were assessed based on a disability scale developed
for use in community-based cohorts (26): bathing, dressing,
grooming, feeding, toileting, walking around home, and
getting up from a chair. Participants were asked if they were
able to perform an activity unassisted (0 points), unassisted
but with difﬁculty (1 point), or whether they required assistance or were unable to do the activity (2 points). A summary disability score was then computed (range 0–14).
Disability was deﬁned as inability or requiring assistance
from another person to do any one of these tasks. General
cognitive status was assessed by the Blessed InformationMemory-Concentration Test (27). Visual acuity was measured with a Snellen’s chart (<1/200 low acuity). Study
clinicians rated gaits as normal or abnormal following visual inspection of walking patterns (10). This clinical rating
has high interrater reliability, and gait abnormalities diagnosed by this method have predicted risk for dementia, institutionalization, and death in our cohort (10,24). Unipedal
stance time, a sensitive balance test, was recorded as the
time participants balanced on one foot without support
(maximum 30 seconds; 28). Time taken to get up from a
chair ﬁve times unassisted was recorded as a test of balance
and lower extremity strength (6).

Data Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared with descriptive
statistics, applying nonparametric tests as appropriate. To
analyze longitudinal fall data, we used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a binomial distribution to model
the probability of fall at each follow-up assessment using
the log link function (29). GEE method is an extension of
generalized linear models for analyzing longitudinal data
(30). It can accommodate different follow-up lengths and
missing data. It has the advantage that the parameter estimate from GEE analysis is consistent as long as the model
for the marginal mean is correctly speciﬁed. This method
has been used in other fall studies (17,19). Risk ratios (RRs)
and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated from the
models.
We selected gait speed (10 cm/s units) and six other
markers that have predicted adverse outcomes in our studies
(21) as predictors of falls: stride length (10 cm decrease),
cadence (10 step decrease), swing phase (10% decrease),
double-support phase (10% increase), stride length variability (10% increase), and swing time variability (10% increase). Variability variables are reported as coefﬁcient of
variation (100 × standard deviation/mean). We reported performance in other individual measures as 10-unit changes to
make our observations clinically intuitive. For instance, the

898

VERGHESE ET AL.

10 cm/s unit is considered a meaningful change in speed
over 1 year in older adults (31). Improvement of similar
magnitude in speed and other gait markers have been noted
with exercise and pharmacological interventions (31–34).
To identify which marker best predicted falls, we used
quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion,
an extension of Akaike information criterion in GEE, as the
goodness-of-ﬁt measure to compare best model ﬁt among
the ﬁve gait markers (35).
All analyses included age, gender, and years of education. The ﬁnal models also included the following baseline
covariates: falls in the year prior to entry, illness index, total
medications, disability score, Blessed test score, unipedal
stance time, and clinical gait abnormalities (5,9,27,28,36).
Univariate associations of these covariates with fall risk
were examined using GEE models. The following variables
did not inﬂuence results in preliminary analyses and were
not included in reported models: individual illnesses, speciﬁc medications (psychotropics or sedatives), clinical
strength and sensory rating, depressive symptoms, low visual acuity, and repeated chair time.
Single gait variables are often highly correlated so that
their independent effects on risk for falls may be hard to
observe while adjusting for other gait variables. To address
this issue, we used factor analysis as a complementary statistical approach. The seven individual gait variables were
submitted to principal components analysis using varimax
rotation to derive orthogonal statistically independent factors (see Table 2) that were used as predictors in the GEE
analysis previously described.
We repeated the aforementioned analysis with injurious
falls as the outcomes to corroborate our ﬁndings. To account
for frail individuals having more falls or recall bias for falls
among cognitively impaired participants (37), we conducted
sensitivity analyses excluding participants with disability or
with cognitive impairment (presence of dementia or Blessed
test scores greater than 7; 27).

Results
The 597 eligible participants completed 4478 telephone
and in-house follow-up assessments. Falls were reported in
415 interviews (9.2%). The mean number of telephone and
in-house follow-up interviews completed during the study
period was 7.5 (range 1–18), corresponding to a mean
follow-up of 20 months (SD 11). The median time to ﬁrst
fall from baseline was 8 months (interquartile range 4–17
months). Falls occurred in 226 participants (38%), of whom
115 fell once and 111 had recurrent falls. The mean fall rate
during the study period was 0.44 per person-year. Participants who fell during follow-up were older at baseline
(mean age 81.1 vs 80.1 years, p = .04) than those who did
not fall.
Baseline sample characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Average age of the participants was 80.6 years. There were

227 men (38%) and 370 women (62%). Older age (RR
1.032, p = .02) was associated with increased fall risk.
Among standard clinical tests done at baseline, gait abnormalities diagnosed by clinicians (RR 1.431, p = .005) and
disability scores (RR 1.116, p = .009) predicted increased
fall risk in univariate models.
Gait Speed
The mean gait speed was 92.8 ± 24.1 cm/s. Slower speed
was associated with increased risk of falls (RR per 10 cm/s
decrease 1.069, 95% CI 1.001–1.142), even after adjustments for potential confounders and traditional clinical tests
of cognition, gait, and balance (Table 3). Clinical gait abnormality and disability scores were not signiﬁcant in the
ﬁnal models that included gait speed.
Gait speed of less than 70 cm/s is used to deﬁne slow gait
(13). Participants with gait speed less than 70 (RR 1.540,
95% CI 1.095–2.150) and with speeds between 70 and 100
cm/s (RR 1.276, 95% CI 0.906–1.768) had an increased risk
for falling compared with participants with gait speed more
than 100 cm/s. The results were not signiﬁcant when adjusted for additional covariates, although the direction of
the associations was similar.
Other Gait Markers
Table 3 shows that among the six other gait markers, worse
performance on swing (RR 1.406, 95% CI 1.027–1.926),
double-support phase (RR 1.165, 95% CI 1.026–1.321),
swing time variability (RR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004–1.010), and
stride length variability (RR 1.076, 95% CI 1.030–1.111)
predicted fall risk in the ﬁnal models. All variables remained
signiﬁcant even after statistical corrections for multiple comparisons (data not shown; 38).

Model comparisons indicated that stride length variability had the best ﬁt in the ﬁnal models among the seven gait
variables, including speed (35).
Gait Factors
Factor analysis of the seven gait variables resulted in
three factors that accounted for 82% variance in gait performance and was similar to the factor structure in our previous study (Table 2). The ﬁrst factor loaded heavily on speed,
cadence, and stride length, and was termed the pace factor.
The second factor loaded heavily on double support and
swing, and was termed rhythm factor. The ﬁnal variability
factor loaded heavily on the two gait variability variables. In
the fully adjusted models, the variability (RR for 1 SD increase 1.067, 95% CI 1.034–1.099) and rhythm factors (RR
1.099, 95% CI 1.001–1.226) were associated with fall rates
but not the pace factor (RR 1.120, 95% CI 0.972–1.290).
Sensitivity Analyses
Injuries occurred in 46% of falls. The injurious fall rate
was 0.23 per person-year. Women were at higher risk for

injurious falls (RR 1.701, 95% CI 1.234–2.351). In the ﬁnal model, only increased stride length variability (RR
1.128, 95% CI 1.091–1.170) and swing time variability
(RR 1.011, 95% CI 1.008–1.105) predicted injurious falls
(Table 3).
The continuous disability score was associated with increased fall risk in univariate models (Table 1) and included
as a covariate in ﬁnal models. We repeated the analyses
excluding 29 participants with disability (26). In the remaining 568 nondisabled participants, gait speed predicted
fall risk in the initial (RR per 10 cm/s decrease 1.071, 95%
CI 1.019–1.131) and ﬁnal models (RR 1.011, 95% CI
1.001–1.142). Cognitive impairment may result in reduced
recall of falls (37). Hence, we repeated the analyses excluding 35 participants with cognitive impairment (Blessed
scores >7 or dementia). Gait speed still predicted risk for
falls in the initial model (RR 1.082, 95% CI 1.020–1.134)
and showed a trend in the ﬁnal model (RR 1.059, 95% CI
0.991–1.131).
Discussion
In this prospective study of a large well-characterized cohort of community-residing elders, quantitative gait markers were independent and strong predictors of incident falls.
Each 10 cm/s decrease in gait speed was associated with a
7% increased risk for falls. Participants with slow gait speed
(≤70 cm/s) had a 1.5-fold increased risk for falls compared
with those with normal speed. The association between gait
speed and falls remained robust after accounting for several
risk factors that are strongly associated with falls as well as
traditional clinical tests of gait and balance (2,5,9). We have
observed in our previous study that not all quantitative gait
abnormalities have clinical correlates or the subtle clinical
signs associated with quantitative gait dysfunction may be
underrecognized by clinicians (21).

VERGHESE ET AL.

Although dependent on availability of equipment, quantitative gait measures can be easily and quickly collected in
clinical and research settings without requiring attachment
of monitoring devices or extensive training. Gait speed is a
simple and quick option for measuring fall risk. Although
we measured gait speed using an instrumented walkway, it
can be easily measured using a stopwatch. Our analyses also
identiﬁed gait variables such as swing phase, doublesupport phase, and gait variability that better predicted falls
than speed. Our complementary factor analysis identiﬁed
three gait domains; of which variability and rhythm domains
were associated with increased fall risk. The incremental
validity from gait variables reported in this and other studies
over traditional risk factors and clinical tests of gait and balance support further exploration of these measures (20,39).
Although gait may be a marker for fall risk factors such
as age, illness, or frailty, our results suggest that our gait
markers are also directly involved in fall mechanisms. Increased stride length and swing time variability were the
most robust predictors of falls, and the only predictors of
injurious falls. Stance time variability has been reported to
predict incident mobility disability in older adults (40).
These results suggest that measures of temporal and spatial
gait variability have speciﬁc relationships with different
mobility outcomes. However, our factor analysis approach
also indicates that the variability domain overall has utility
in predicting outcomes and providing insights into pathology. Regulation of gait variability is thought to be automated with minimal cognitive input in healthy adults
(20,21). Increased gait variability may lead to unstable gait
or poor balance (39,41), increasing fall risk. Increased variability of step length was associated with greater burden of
subclinical brain vascular abnormalities in high-functioning
older adult (42). Neurodegenerative processes may also result in disturbed gait regulation (21). These results suggest
that discrete pathological processes may underlie disturbed
gait regulation. Our ﬁndings have possible therapeutic implications. The individual gait variables identiﬁed are potentially modiﬁable factors. For instance, gait variability
and double-support phase were reported to improve with
treadmill training or pharmacological interventions (33,34).
Slower gait is associated with executive dysfunction and
cerebrovascular disease (24,25), which may be amenable to
interventions.

Limitations
This nested cohort study was necessarily restricted to participants who received gait and fall assessments since 2004,
but participants seen previously were not differentially excluded. We did not study all possible aspects of gait, although most other gait variables can be derived or are highly
correlated with our empirically selected measures (20,21,25).
Poor recall of falls is linked to cognitive impairment and
longer assessment intervals (37). The short intervals and

high interview completion rates help reduce errors in our
study. Our contact interval was longer than studies where
monthly fall calendars were used but similar or shorter than
those using telephone interviews (9,17,19). A more detailed
fall collection method was not utilized as falls were not the
primary outcome in our parent studies. Hence, it is likely
that we may have underestimated effects. However, adjusting for cognitive status or excluding cognitively impaired
individuals did not change our results. Gait variability also
predicted injurious and recurrent falls, which are less prone
to recall bias (37). Previously described single fall risk factors were not signiﬁcantly associated with falls (Table 1),
although the directions of the associations were in the right
direction. Many of these risk factors have been examined in
smaller samples. Differences in populations, fall and risk
factor assessment methods, and deﬁnitions used for risk factors may also account for differing results.
The intensity of assessment will depend on the clinical
setting (8). Gait speed could be examined as a brief and
simple screen to complement current fall risk assessments
in primary care settings (5,8). In high-risk patients, in specialty clinics, or in research settings, a more comprehensive
gait evaluation including markers such as gait variability
may be considered. Quantitative gait markers are independent predictors of falls in older adults and should be further
studied to improve current fall risk assessments and tested
as intervention targets.
