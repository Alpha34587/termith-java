Abstract
In a previous paper (Hemila et al., Hear. Res. 133 (1999) 82^97) we have presented a mechanical model, based on species-specific
«
anatomical data, for the toothed whale middle ear. For five odontocete species of six we found that the model quite well predicted
published behavioral audiograms. Here we report that new published data indicate that the audiogram of the sixth and deviating
species, the killer whale Orcinus orca, was from a specimen with deficient high-frequency hearing. A new published killer whale
audiogram is similar to other odontocete audiograms and does fit our four-bone model. With certain general conditions, a model
with isometric (middle) ears results in uniform audiograms for different species, when presented in a log^log plot; with larger ears the
audiogram curves are just moved towards lower frequencies. The audiograms coincide in case all frequencies are scaled by a factor
p
1a 3 m, where m is the mass of the ear ossicles. Odontocete ears are isometric enough to show that the corresponding audiograms are
indeed similar after such mass scaling. Specifically, this scaling factor can be used to predict the high-frequency hearing limits of all
odontocete species. Our anatomical data and models support the notion that ossicular mass is a crucial factor limiting highfrequency hearing in both terrestrial mammals and toothed whales. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In a recent study we have successfully related audiograms of ¢ve toothed whales to the middle ear anatomy
of the same ¢ve species (Hemila et al., 1999; Nummela
«
et al., 1999b). A behavioral audiogram of a sixth species, the killer whale Orcinus orca, was also available
(Hall and Johnson, 1972). However, for this species our
modeling approach was less successful ; the behavioral
audiogram is exceptionally narrow (high sensitivity only
within a narrow frequency range), and shows an abrupt
high-frequency cut-o¡ at 30 kHz, compared to 100^140
kHz cut-o¡s for other toothed whales. When we tried
to adapt our model to ¢t this exceptional high-frequency part we found that the model predicted 20^40
dB too high sensitivities at lower frequencies. As a con-

clusion we noted that `we have no good explanation for
these shortcomings of the model' (Hemila et al., 1999,
«
p. 91). This was somewhat embarassing as our anatomical work had speci¢cally focused on the killer whale
middle ear (Nummela et al., 1999a). Here we report
that two new Orcinus audiograms (Szymanski et al.,
1999), published one month after our 1999 reports,
are in good agreement with other odontocete audiograms, and with the Orcinus version of our middle ear
model. At the same time we can now give a quantitative
explanation for the experimental observation that different odontocete audiograms extend to di¡erent highfrequency ranges.
Szymanski et al. (1999) trained two adult female killer whales, and measured from both of them two audiograms, one based on behavioral responses, and the other on evoked potentials recorded from the auditory
brainstem. Except for the highest frequency (100
kHz), the averaged behavioral audiogram agreed well
with the averaged brainstem responses (Fig. 1). The

model

and Johnson, 1972). E, the audiogram of the false killer whale
(Thomas et al., 1988). The new reference 1 WPa has been substituted
for the old reference 1 dyn/cm2 = 0.1 Pa by adding 100 dB to the
old audiogram threshold levels.

new killer whale audiograms are similar to the behavioral audiogram of the false killer whale (Thomas et al.,
1988), while they di¡er drastically from the killer whale
thresholds presented by Hall and Johnson (1972).
Behavioral and electrophysiological responses both
have their methodological pros and cons. In previous
modeling work we have related our middle ear data to
behavioral responses (Hemila et al., 1995, 1999), and
«
thus we here too mainly focus on behavioral data to
make the present analysis compatible with earlier presentations.
2. Basic assumptions
Middle ear modeling of the type presented below is
based on the idea that the behavioral acoustic thresholds at di¡erent frequencies correspond to constant
minimum intensities of the hydrodynamic wave in the
inner ear (Lynch et al., 1982; Hemila et al., 1995). Over
«
the main hearing range of the animal the middle ear
would represent a dominating acoustic ¢lter determining the main shape of the audiogram (Zwislocki, 1962 ;
Kringlebotn, 1988). However, as shown by our previous
modeling work with odontocete audiograms, and with
audiograms of small rodents and bats, the ¢nal sharp
threshold rises observed at 100^140 kHz cannot be fully
accounted for by known middle ear ¢lters. We have
assumed that this rise contains a signi¢cant component
related to reduced cochlear sensitivity (Hemila et al.,
«
1995, 1999 ; Nummela, 1997).

Let us brie£y sum up the anatomical basis and functional background of the odontocete middle ear model,
presented by Nummela et al. (1999a) and Hemila et al.
«
(1999). The tympano-periotic complex forming the ear
region consists of a ventral bowl-shaped tympanic bone
in direct contact with the surrounding soft tissues
through which the incident sound enters; and of a
dorsal periotic bone containing the inner ear. Apparently sound brings the tympanic bone, and especially its thin tympanic plate, into vibration. The ossicles in the air-¢lled middle ear cavity form a bridge
from the tympanic plate to the periotic bone, connecting the vibrating plate to the oval window and the inner
ear.
At optimum frequencies the absolute threshold intensities (power densities, W/m2 ) for hearing in toothed
whales are very low, in fact lower than the threshold
intensities of most terrestrial mammals. Assuming that
the cochlear sensitivities in odontocetes and terrestrial
mammals are roughly equal, this has three implications: (1) in the odontocete middle ear, sound energy
from a large collecting area is focused on a small oval
window; (2) at the frequency of best hearing, the energy
of the incident sound wave enters the ear with little
re£ection. Thus the speci¢c input impedance of the cochlea has to be fairly well matched to the characteristic
acoustic impedance of water; (3) the couplings between
the middle ear bones cannot absorb a large fraction of
the vibrational energy.
2.2. The odontocete middle ear model
In our four-bone model, which ful¢lls the above three
conditions quite well (Hemila et al., 1999), the acoustic
«
matching is realized by lever mechanisms and elastic
couplings between the middle ear bones. The model is
based on the actual anatomy of the tympano-periotic
complex, i.e. on directly measured masses, areas and
lengths, speci¢c for each of the six species for which
behavioral audiograms exist (Nummela et al., 1999b).
It further contains ¢ve spring constants and four damping factors which were adjusted within reasonable limits. The adjustment was performed by varying the
spring constants and damping factors as described in
Hemila et al. (1999, Appendix 2) until an optimum ¢t
«
was obtained with the six behavioral audiograms published by Johnson (1967), bottlenose dolphin; Andersen
(1971), harbor porpoise; Hall and Johnson (1972), killer whale; White et al. (1972), beluga whale ; Jacobs and
Hall (1972), Amazon dolphin; and Thomas et al.
(1988), false killer whale.

3. Modeling the new killer whale audiogram

4. Discussion

Following the above procedure we have optimized
the ¢t of the four-bone model for the killer whale to
the averaged behavioral audiogram of Szymanski et al.
(1999). All the masses, areas and lengths are the same
as those presented by Nummela et al. (1999b) and
Hemila et al. (1999), while the adjustable parameters
«
are changed to ¢t the new behavioral audiogram.
While the model even after careful optimizing procedures failed to describe the experimental data of Hall
and Johnson (1972), the new optimized curve does ¢t
the averaged behavioral thresholds of Szymanski et al.
(1999) reasonably well (Fig. 2). At 100 kHz the model
curve passes 9 dB above the behavioral threshold. The
brainstem threshold, on the other hand, lies far above
the model; possible reasons for this large discrepancy
between the behavioral and electrophysiological brainstem audiograms at 100 kHz are thoroughly discussed
by Szymanski et al. (1999). They conclude that the
brainstem thresholds `only can provide a rough estimate of hearing sensitivity at a given frequency'. However, it is worth pointing out that, at 100 kHz, the
brainstem responses showed very high thresholds for
both killer whales, and that only one of the animals
showed any behavioral responses to strong 120 kHz
sound. Thus the thresholds indeed seem to rise steeply
above 90^100 kHz.

Hall and Johnson's (1972) audiogram, based on one
male killer whale, is the result of a careful study, and its
abrupt cut-o¡ at 30 kHz obviously re£ects the real situation. Szymanski et al. (1999) who studied two females
do not think that sexual dimorphism is a probable explanation of the observed di¡erence (suggesting instead
possible cochlear damage in this particular male). Admittedly, the model presented by Hemila et al. (1999) is
«
based on anatomical data from one adult female middle
ear, and killer whales do show a modest sexual dimorphism in size, adult females being about 25% lighter
than males (Je¡erson et al., 1993). Yet, studying one
female and one male killer whale ear complex, we
have observed no sexual dimorphism in size or shape.
In terrestrial mammals, the high-frequency hearing
limit (fH ) is inversely proportional to the cubic root
p of
the mass of the vibrating structures, i.e. f H O1a 3 W ,
where fH is the high-frequency hearing limit, and W
stands for the summed mass of malleus and incus.
This relationship is expected under certain assumptions
(Hemila et al., 1995), the essential condition being that
«
middle ear structures of di¡erent species scale isometrically. This is roughly true in terrestrial mammals over
the whole size range from 
p small bats to elephants
(Nummela, 1995). The 1a 3 W rule is not, however,
based on any speci¢c mechanical model. Thus we can
test its applicability to whales although their middle ear
geometry is di¡erent from that of terrestrial mammals
(a condition being that whale middle ears are mutually
isometric).
The four-bone model of Hemila et al. (1999) suggests
«
that, also in the case of whales, ossicular mass is of
crucial importance for high-frequency hearing. Within
the whole hearing range the sound wave ¢rst elicits a
vibration of the tympanic bone. However, in a given
range of high frequencies the vibration amplitude at
the oval window is strongly ampli¢ed by resonances
of ossicle vibrations, and thus critically a¡ected by ossicular masses.
Isometric scaling applies within the critical ossicle
system: the relation between the stapes mass and the
mass of the malleus^incus complex is isometric, and the
same applies to the relation between the oval window
area and the ossicle mass raised to the power 2/3 (Nummela et  1999b). Thus we expect a relationship
p al.,
f H O1a 3 m for odontocetes, where m stands for the
summed mass of all three ossicles.
The deviating killer whale audiogram led us to conclude that for whales the above cubic root relationship
does not hold on a quantitative level (Hemila et al.,
«
1999, p. 93). Thus the good ¢t to the new Orcinus
audiograms is important and enables us to reconsider
a quantitative interpretation. We de¢ne the high-fre-

quency hearing limit fH for each of the six species by
¢rst drawing a smooth curve through the experimental
high-frequency threshold points, and then determining
a frequency where the threshold has risen 25 dB above
the minimum. By selecting a point on the early rising
phase we avoid the ¢nal abrupt cut-o¡ which may be
more related to cochlear limitations than to middle ear
¢ltering.
As seen in Fig. 3A, the frequency for the hearing

limit as de¢ned above (fH ) indeed turns out to be
roughly inversely proportional to the cubic root of the
total ossicle mass ; thus ossicle inertia seems to be an
important factor limiting odontocete high-frequency
hearing.
If all middle ear structures were strictly isometric, the
shapes of the audiograms in log^log plots would be
identical (Hemila et al., 1999, p. 93; Nummela, 1997).
«
Moreover, when scaled for mass ratios, all audiograms
would coincide. We tested this prediction in spite of the
fact that the odontocete middle ears are not perfectly
isometric; although the mutual relation between the
tympanic and periotic bones is fairly constant, and
the same applies to the relations between the ossicles,
the relation between these two complexes (the tympanoperiotic complex and the ossicular complex) deviates
from isometry (Nummela et al., 1999b). Moreover,
full isometry would presuppose that the model parameters of the elastic couplings are isometrically scaled,
but model simulations indicate that the values of k
and c deviate considerably from such isometry.
Fig. 3B presents behavioral audiograms of the six
odontocete species listed above, normalized to the
same level of lowest threshold. The killer whale thresholds start to rise steeply at 60^70 kHz while the thresholds of the small bottlenose dolphin rise steeply above
100 kHz. In Fig. 3C the thresholds from Fig. 3B are
doubly scaled, not only vertically to the same level of
lowest threshold but also horizontally according to the
cubic root of the mass of the ossicles. Now the audiograms of ¢ve species seem to coincide quite nicely, especially at their initial rise towards the high-frequency
cut-o¡. A `standard shape' for these ¢ve audiograms
can be discerned.
The audiogram of the sixth and smallest species, the
harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena, clearly deviates
from the `standard audiogram', suggesting large deviations from the general isometric structure. These deviations are probably due to elastic couplings as the bone

mass relations of the ear of the harbor porpoise do not
deviate from those of other odontocetes (Nummela et
al., 1999b). In a previous study we have suggested that
the particular characteristics of the porpoise audiogram
are related to exceptional elastic couplings (Hemila et
«
al., 1999, p. 91).
In terrestrial mammals the importance of ossicular
inertia in limiting high-frequency hearing is generally
perceived (Henson, 1974), and this factor was quantitatively analyzed by Hemila et al. (1995). Here we have
«
proposed that the high-frequency thresholds of toothed
whales are also limited by the inertia of the middle ear
bones. It may seem surprising that whales with massive
middle ear structures have similar high-frequency hearing as small terrestrial mammals. To illuminate this apparent paradox in animal acoustics, let us take a closer
look at two well investigated species. The feral mouse
and the killer whale have hearing thresholds that rise
rather similarly in the region 20^100 kHz, the killer
whale audiogram, though, being slightly displaced towards higher frequencies. The lowest mouse threshold
lies at 16 kHz, and the threshold has risen by 25 dB at
about 50^60 kHz (Ehret, 1974; He¡ner and Masterton,
1980). The corresponding frequencies for the killer
whale are 20 and 70 kHz.
On the other hand, the masses of the vibrating structures are very di¡erent. The summed mass of the mouse
ossicles (0.31 mg) and tympanic membrane is about
0.35 mg, while the summed mass of the killer whale
tympanic bone and ossicles is 87 g (Nummela, 1995,
and the author's unpublished tympanic membrane
data; Nummela et al., 1999b). Thus the vibrating structures of the killer whale are about 250 000 times heavier. A closer examination reveals, however, that the
observed audiogram similarity, as well as the direction
of the di¡erence, are expected.
Let us consider a simpli¢ed situation where a sound
wave (sound pressure p, particle velocity u) hits a freely
mobile bone structure of mass m and target area A. In
this order-of-magnitude estimation sound re£ection is
neglected. Thus the oscillatory force acting on the
bone structure is pA and the oscillatory velocity of
the bone is u. At the high-frequency limit (angular frequency gH ) most of the force pA acts as an inertial
force bringing the mass m into oscillatory acceleration
a. Therefore we may write pAWma = mgH u. Taking
into account that p/u is the characteristic acoustic impedance Z of the medium, the high-frequency limit
should be proportional to ZA/m. In the case of the
mouse, Z is that of air, 400 Pa s/m; A, the area of
the tympanic membrane, is 4.22 mm2 (Nummela,
1995); and m, the summed mass of the mouse ossicles
and tympanic membrane, is 0.35 mg. For the killer
whale Z is that of water, 1.5W106 Pa s/m; A, the tympanic plate area, is 1830 mm2 ; and the tympanic bone

225

and ossicular mass is 87 000 mg (Nummela et al.,
1999b). For the mouse ZA/mW5 000 s31 , and for the
killer whale ZA/mW30 000 s31 . Thus it is not surprising
that the high-frequency limit of the killer whale is somewhat displaced towards higher frequencies. The large
value of Z in water reduces the e¡ect of inertia of the
tympanic bone in two ways: the large pressure p increases the force pA and the small particle velocity u
decreases the acceleration amplitude.
