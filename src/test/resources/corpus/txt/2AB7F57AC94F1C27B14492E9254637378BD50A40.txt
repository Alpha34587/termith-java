Abstract
Vaccinations with A␤1– 42 have been shown to reduce amyloid burden in transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have
further tested the efﬁcacy of A␤1– 42 immunization in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD by immunizing one group of mice with minimal
A␤ deposition, one group of mice with modest A␤ deposition, and one group with signiﬁcant A␤ deposition. The effects of immunization
on A␤ deposition were examined using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. In Tg2576 mice immunized prior to signiﬁcant
amyloid deposition, A␤1– 42 immunization was highly effective. Biochemically extracted A␤40 and A␤42 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced
and immunohistochemical plaque load was also reduced. Immunization of mice with modest amounts of pre-existing A␤ deposits selectively
reduced A␤42 without altering A␤40, although plaque load was reduced. In contrast, in Tg2576 mice with signiﬁcant pre-existing A␤ loads,
A␤1– 42 immunization only minimally decreased A␤42 levels, whereas no alteration in A␤40 levels or in plaque load was observed. These
results indicate that in Tg2576 mice, A␤1– 42 immunization is more effective at preventing additional A␤ accumulation and does not result
in signiﬁcant clearance of pre-existing A␤ deposits. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Amyloid-beta peptides (A␤) appear to play a causal role
in the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [3,13,
14,15]. While most therapeutic strategies have focused on
the identiﬁcation of molecular targets and the development
of small molecule inhibitors of A␤ production and/or ﬁbril
formation, recent work by Schenk et al. [12] has shifted
attention to the therapeutic potential of increasing A␤ clearance by inducing a robust humoral immune response to A␤
in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model of AD [2]. Specifically, this group immunized 6-week old PDAPP mice that
have no A␤ deposits, and 11-month-old mice that have
modest A␤ deposits. Using ﬁbrillar A␤1– 42 as an immunogen, they found that in those animals, which developed a
high anti-A␤ antibody titer, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in biochemically detected A␤ load, plaque burden,
neuritic dystrophy and gliosis. Signiﬁcantly, this study not
only showed that A␤ immunization prevented A␤ deposi-

tion in young PDAPP mice, but also attenuated A␤ deposition in mice that were not immunized until they had
developed A␤ deposits. These studies have now been extended to other protocols. In one study, passive transfer of
anti-A␤ speciﬁc antibodies were shown to reduce amyloid
burden in the PDAPP transgenic mice, providing strong
evidence that the efﬁcacy of A␤ immunization could be
attributed directly to the production of anti-A␤ antibodies
[1]. In another study in PDAPP mice, nasal administration
of A␤40 and A␤42 was shown to reduce amyloid plaque
burden [9]. More recently, two groups have independently
shown that following immunization with A␤1– 42 in different APP transgenic mouse models, there was improvement
in cognitive deﬁcits in the transgenic mice, as ascertained by
a reference memory version of the Morris water maze test
[7] or a radial-arm water maze test of working memory [11].
Although vaccination with A␤1– 42 invariably resulted in
improvement of memory deﬁcits, in some cases the immunohistochemical plaque load was only moderately reduced
and changes in A␤ levels were not observed [7,11].
In this paper, we have used the Tg2576 mouse model of
AD [4] to test the efﬁcacy of A␤1– 42 immunization in mice
with varying degrees of amyloid burden at the time of

immunization. Tg2576 mice develop isolated dense-cored
plaques that contain both A␤40 and A␤42 beginning at 7– 8
months of age. By 10 –11 months of age plaque number is
increased so that a few cores are typically present in each
section. Plaque formation continues progressively in these
mice so that by 15–16 months, A␤ plaques in the Tg2576
brain accumulate to levels similar to those seen in AD brain
[4,8]. Biochemical assessment of A␤ deposition closely
parallels the appearance of plaques, as accumulation of
SDS-insoluble formic acid requiring A␤ invariably occurs
by 8 months of age, but can be detected as early as 6 months
of age. As Tg2576 mice age, both SDS-soluble and SDSinsoluble formic acid extractable A␤ accumulate exponentially between 6 –12 months of age and continue to increase
thereafter. For our experiments, we tested the effects of
immunization on three different age groups of Tg2576 mice
that have markedly different levels of preexisting A␤ deposits: 7– 8 month old mice (early-amyloid), 10 –11 month
old mice (moderate-amyloid), and 18-month-old (heavyamyloid). Mice were immunized with ﬁbrillar A␤1– 42 and
the anti-A␤ immune response and effects of this response
on A␤ deposition were analyzed by biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. Our results demonstrate
that A␤1– 42 immunization of Tg2576 mice is effective in
reducing amyloid burden in young mice (early-amyloid
groups) but does not signiﬁcantly alter amyloid burden in
older (heavy-amyloid) Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, in contrast with reports on the PDAPP mice [12], immunization of
Tg2576 mice with A␤1– 42 appears to be more effective in
reducing A␤42 than A␤40. This selectivity is most apparent
in the older Tg2576 mice with heavy amyloid loads, where
A␤1– 42 immunization only reduced A␤42 levels without
altering A␤40 levels or plaque load.

2. Methods
2.1. Peptides
A␤1– 42 peptide (derived from the human A␤ sequence)
was purchased from American Peptide Company, CA. For
preparation of aggregate forms of A␤1– 42, 2 mg of lyophilized peptide was added to 1 ml 1ϫ PBS, vortexed and
incubated overnight at 37°C as described previously [12].
2.2. Immunizations
For immunizations, freshly prepared peptide (100␮g/
immunization) was emulsiﬁed in 1:1 (vol/vol) of Freund’s
adjuvant (Diffco Labs, MI). Tg2576 mice (n ϭ 4) were
immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100␮g A␤1– 42
peptide in CFA (1st injection) and boosted with 100␮g
peptide in IFA on DAY 14 and monthly thereafter for 4
months (the 18-month-old, heavy-amyloid group was immunized for 3 months). Control groups (n ϭ 4) were im-

munized with PBS/adjuvant alone for the same time periods
as described above.
2.3. Mouse IgG ELISA
To test whether Tg2576 mice generate anti-peptide antibody responses, serum titers of immunized mice were
determined by standard ELISA techniques. Brieﬂy, microtitre plates (Maxi Sorp, Dynatech) were coated with aggregated A␤42 and control peptides (1 ug/well). After washings, serial dilutions of sera were added and incubated
overnight at 4°C. Following washes with PBS/0.1% tween20, serum IgG was detected using a goat anti-mouse conjugated with HRP (Sigma Chemicals, MO) and TMB substrate (KPL). Antibody titer concentrations were determined
using serial dilutions of monoclonal antibody 4G8 as the
standard.
2.4. Capture ELISA for analysis of biochemically
extracted A␤
At sacriﬁce the brains of mice were divided by midsaggital dissection, and one hemibrain used for biochemical
analysis. Each hemibrain was sequentially extracted in a
2-step procedure described previously [8,13]. Brieﬂy, each
hemibrain (150 mg/ml wet weight) was sonicated in 2%
SDS with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 100,000ϫ g
for 1hr at 4°C. Following centrifugation, the resultant supernatant was collected, representing the SDS-soluble fraction. The resultant pellet was then extracted in 70% formic
acid (FA), centrifuged and the resultant supernatant collected (the FA fraction). The following antibodies against
A␤ were used in the sandwich capture ELISA: Polyclonal
3160 (anti-A␤40) was used for capture and BA-27 (speciﬁc
for A␤1– 40) and BC-05 (speciﬁc for A␤1– 42) were used
for detection.
2.5. Quantitative immunohistology of amyloid plaques
Hemibrains of mice were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.6) and then stained
for A␤ plaques as follows. Parafﬁn sections (5 ␮m) were
pretreated with 70% formic acid for 5 min and immersed in
0.3% of H2O2 for 30 min to block intrinsic peroxidase. They
were then incubated with 2% blocking serum in PBS for one
hour, with primary antibody (Monoclonal Bam-10 clone
(A␤1– 40 speciﬁc, Sigma Chemicals) at 1:10,000 dilution
overnight, and then with horseradish peroxidase conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Amersham) for one
hour. Immunoreactivity was visualized by DAB according
to manufactures speciﬁcations (Vector labs). Computer assisted quantiﬁcation of A␤ plaques was performed using
Sigma Scanpro program (Jandel Scientiﬁc). Serial coronal
sections stained as above were captured and the threshold
for plaque staining was determined and kept constant
throughout the analysis. For analysis of plaque burden in the

methods: (A) 7– 8 month old group FA extracted A␤42 (*P ϭ 0.01) and FA A␤40 (**P ϭ 0.02); (B) 7– 8 month-old group SDS-soluble A␤42 and SDS

SDS A␤40: (E) 18 month-old group FA extracted A␤42 (*P ϭ 0.07) and FA A␤40 (F) 18 month-old group SDS A␤42 (*P ϭ 0.03) and SDS A␤40.

10 –11 month old group, immunostained plaques were
quantiﬁed (% area and plaque counts) in the neocortex of
the same plane of section for each mouse. For analysis of
plaque burden in the 18 month-old group, immunostained
plaques were quantiﬁed in both the hippocampus and the
adjacent parietal neocortex. All the above analyses were
performed in a blinded fashion.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between treatment groups were
analyzed using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test.

3. Results
3.1. Biochemically extracted A␤ is selectively altered in
brains of A␤1– 42 immunized Tg2576 mice
For analysis of amyloid burden, brain tissue was harvested at the end of the experimentation period and A␤
content determined in each hemibrain by sandwich ELISA
[8]. SDS-soluble (SDS) and SDS-insoluble formic-acid extractable (FA) fractions were analyzed. As shown in Fig.
1A, in the 7– 8 month old Tg2576 mice (early-amyloid)
immunized with A␤1– 42, there was signiﬁcant decrease in

724

A␤42 in the FA fractions, representing an 81% reduction
versus control group (P ϭ 0.01) and 45% less A␤42 in the
SDS fractions (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the levels of A␤40 were
dramatically reduced in the FA-fractions (Fig. 1A, representing an 85% reduction, P ϭ 0.02), and SDS fractions
(Fig 1B, 75% reduction, P ϭ 0.04). In the second group of
A␤42 immunized mice (10 –11 month old, moderate-amyloid), there was also signiﬁcant reduction of A␤42 in the FA
fractions (Fig. 1C, 37% less vs. controls, P ϭ 0.03) as well
as in the SDS fractions (Fig. 1D, representing an 45%
reduction, P ϭ 0.01). A slight reduction in A␤40 levels was
observed in both the FA fractions (Fig. 1C) and the SDS
fractions (Fig. 1D) in these mice, but these reductions were
not signiﬁcant. In the last group of mice (heavy-amyloid,
18-month old) immunized with A␤1– 42, the levels of A␤42
were slightly reduced, in both the FA fractions (Fig. 1E,
25% reduction, P ϭ 0.07) as well as the SDS fraction (Fig.
1F, 27% reduction, P ϭ 0.03). Although there was only a
25% reduction in A␤42 in the FA fraction of the 18-monthold mice, this reduction is in fact quite large in absolute
amounts. For example, there was approximately 2000 pM/g
of FA42 reduced in the A␤1– 42 immunized 18-month-old
Tg2576 mice compared to approximately 310 pM/g of
FA42 being reduced in the A␤1– 42 immunized 10 –11
month-old Tg2576 mice. Lastly, in this age group, there
were no signiﬁcant changes in the A␤40 levels between
both treatment groups, in either the FA fractions (Fig. 1E) or
SDS fractions (Fig. 1F).
3.2. A␤1– 42 immunization reduces A␤ plaque deposits in
young Tg2576 mice but not in older mice
Coronal sections of mouse hemibrains from each of the
three experimental groups were analyzed for changes in
immunostained A␤ plaques using quantitative image analysis. For the early-amyloid group (7– 8 month-old Tg2576
mice) quantitative image analysis of plaque burden (%
mean plaque area) was not informative. At the time of
sacriﬁce (11–12 months of age), these mice have only small,
isolated plaques in various regions of the brain and quantitative changes between the treatment groups were minimal
and therefore difﬁcult to interpret. However, by simple
plaque counts (performed in a blinded fashion), only one
mouse in the immunized group (n ϭ 4) had a single isolated
plaque in the coronal sections examined whereas in sections
of all 4 mice in the control group, at least one or more A␤
plaques were detected (mean plaque count 0.05 Ϯ 0.1/
section in immunized group vs 0.35 Ϯ 0.2/section in controls, P ϭ 0.04). Representative immunostained sections are
shown in Fig. 3A (control) and Fig. 3B (immunized). In the
second group of mice (10 –11 month old at immunization,
moderate-amyloid load), quantitative image analysis (Fig.
2A) revealed that there was a signiﬁcant decrease (P ϭ
0.05) in plaque burden in the cerebral cortex of the A␤1– 42
immunized mice (0.15 Ϯ 0.07% mean area) verses the
control group (0.73 Ϯ 0.29% mean area). Similarly, a com-

parison of plaque counts between the A␤1– 42 immunized
mice versus control mice, revealed a highly signiﬁcant decrease (Fig. 2B, P ϭ 0.005) in plaque numbers in the
A␤1– 42 immunized mice (mean plaque count 3.75 Ϯ 0.47
vs 6.25 Ϯ 0.47 in controls). Representative immunostained
sections from these mice are shown in Fig. 3C, 3D. In the
last group of Tg2576 mice (heavy-amyloid group), quantitative image analysis revealed no statistical differences in
plaque burden in the hippocampus of the A␤1– 42 immunized mice (2.75 Ϯ 0.41% mean area, Fig. 2C) versus the
control group (2.61 Ϯ 0.41% mean area). Similarly, there
were no signiﬁcant differences in plaque burden in the neo
cortex of the A␤1– 42 immunized mice (4.90 Ϯ 0.79%
mean area, Fig. 2D) versus the control group (5.59 Ϯ 1.25%
mean area, representative immunostained section shown in
Fig. 3E, 3F). In addition, there were no detectable differences in plaque number (not shown).
3.3. A␤1– 42 immunized Tg2576 mice generate high antiA␤ antibody titers
One critical parameter that we wished to ascertain was
whether decrease in amyloid burden in the A␤1– 42 immunized Tg2576 mice correlated with the generation of anti-A␤ antibody responses. As shown in Table 1, all mice
from the different age groups immunized with A␤1– 42
generated robust antibody titers against A␤1– 42 (ranging
from 7–15␮g/ml) on day 30 and these titers were maintained throughout the experimentation period. Pre-immune
sera (day 0) and control mice immunized with adjuvant
alone did not generate any detectable anti-A␤ antibody
responses. The speciﬁc isotype of anti-A␤ antibodies was
determined by ELISA using isotype-speciﬁc secondary antibodies against IgA, IgG and IgM. The primary isotype
species in the A␤1– 42 immunized Tg2576 mice was IgG2b
(Table 1), which is characteristic of a Th1 pro-inﬂammatory
response [6]. Furthermore, the anti-A␤ antibodies generated
in A␤1– 42 immunized mice strongly cross-react with A␤40
(titers levels ranging from 5–17␮g/ml), to a lower extent
against A␤1–16 and did not cross-react with sAPP as determined by ELISA (data not shown). We also wanted to
determine whether the circulating anti-A␤ antibodies from
the A␤1– 42 immunized Tg2576 mice were capable of labeling amyloid plaques. As shown in Fig. 4, sera from
immunized mice (1:10,000 dilution), representing the 18month old group, intensely label plaques in Tg2576 mouse
brains whereas sera from adjuvant immunized control mice
do not.

4. Discussion
In this report, we have analyzed the effectiveness of
A␤1– 42 immunizations in three different age groups of
Tg2576 mice with differing loads of amyloid burden. Immunization of the 7– 8 month-old mice (early-amyloid

group) resulted in signiﬁcant attenuation of both A␤40 and
A␤42 deposition as well as plaque accumulation. Immunization of 10 –11 month-old mice with moderate plaque
deposits resulted in a large decrease in immunostained
plaque load and number, a modest reduction of A␤42 accumulation, but had minimal effect on A␤40 accumulation.
These ﬁndings conﬁrm previous reports [7,11,12], which
demonstrate that immunization with A␤1– 42 prior to signiﬁcant plaque load results in modest to signiﬁcant reductions in amyloid burden. Moreover, these studies on Tg2576
mice further demonstrate that the effects of A␤ immunization are not restricted to a single mouse model of AD. In
contrast to the results obtained on mice with low or modest
levels of A␤ deposition at the time of immunization, immunization of 18 month-old mice (heavy-amyloid group)
had no effect on amyloid plaque load and A␤40 levels, and
only a moderate decrease in A␤42 was observed.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for
the effect of A␤1– 42 immunization on A␤ load. First,
anti-A␤ antibodies that are generated could enter the brain,
bind to soluble A␤ and prevent the formation or accumulation of ﬁbrillar A␤ in dense-cored plaques. Second, an-

ti-A␤ antibodies might actually disrupt preexisting A␤
ﬁbrils, thereby promoting A␤ clearance. Third, anti-A␤
antibodies may activate CNS microglial cells to phagocytose either soluble or ﬁbrillar A␤ via Fc receptors. Finally,
any of these mechanisms may act synergistically to reduce
A␤ burden or immunization could alter A␤ through other
mechanisms. Based on our data, which shows that immunization is more effective in attenuating A␤ deposition in
Tg2576 mice prior to signiﬁcant amyloid deposition but
ineffective in reducing plaque load in mice with heavy
amyloid deposits, it would appear that A␤ immunization is
more effective in reducing additional accumulation of A␤
than it is in promoting clearance of established plaques.
A number of factors could account for the different
effects on A␤ deposition on the various age groups of mice
that were immunized. In our initial characterization, we
found no signiﬁcant difference in maximum titer, temporal
course of immune response or isotype response between the
different age groups. Thus, while we cannot completely
discount differences in humoral responses between the various age groups, we believe that differences in antibody
production are unlikely to account for the lack of efﬁcacy in

possible to increase the efﬁcacy of immunization by using
alternate immunization strategies that increase anti-A␤ titers or perhaps increasing the length of time between immunization and termination of the experiment.
With regard to the levels of biochemically extracted A␤,
our results are quite striking in that immunization with
A␤1– 42 appears to selectively alter A␤42 levels and not
A␤40 levels in mice with modest or heavy amyloid loads.
This selective reduction in A␤42 was not reported in previous studies and is not easily explained. Although it is
possible that immunization with aggregated A␤1– 42 preferentially targets A␤42 epitopes, there is no evidence for
production of A␤42 selective antibodies as anti-A␤40 and
anti-A␤42 titers generated are equivalent. As A␤40 levels
are much higher than A␤42 levels in the Tg2576 mouse
brain [4,8], it is possible that the lack of effect on A␤40
simply represents a threshold effect in which there is insufﬁcient antibody produced to alter A␤40 levels. However,
such a selective effect is somewhat counterintuitive, as one
would expect that since equivalent antibody titers are
present, A␤40 and A␤42 should be altered to an equivalent
extent. A more likely explanation is that the selective reduction in A␤42 is due to preferential recognition or clearance of A␤42 by anti-A␤ antibodies. The relevance of this
apparent disparity in A␤ reduction remains to be determined, since it is generally agreed that A␤42 is the more
toxic species [10,14,15] and reduction of A␤40 may not
necessarily be of any clinical beneﬁt. In any case, additional
studies will be needed to resolve this issue.
In all previous reports on A␤ immunization, immunization was initiated prior to signiﬁcant A␤ deposition. In our
study, we ﬁnd that i) the efﬁcacy of vaccination decreases

the older animals. If there truly is no difference in the
antibody response, it is reasonable to suggest that the effect
of A␤ immunization is in part dependent on the amount of
A␤ present in the brain at the time of immunization. As only
small amounts of antibody (less than 0.1% of peripheral
serum levels can cross the blood brain barrier [1,5], such
levels may not be sufﬁcient to bind and alter the large
amounts of A␤ that is present in older Tg2576 mice. It is
also possible that the A␤ deposits change in some fashion
with age becoming more resistant to antibody mediated
interactions; however, there is no evidence for this currently. Finally, it is possible that other age associated factors, such as altered microglial response, may alter the
efﬁcacy of immunization in older animals. Clearly, if the
efﬁcacy of immunization is dependent on the relationship
between antibody titer and pre-existing A␤ load, it may be

with increasing pre-existing A␤ load and ii) in mice with
modest to heavy preexisting amyloid loads, A␤42 is selectively reduced while A␤40 levels appear to be unchanged. It
will be of great interest to see if similar results are obtained
in other mouse models of AD. It is possible that variations
exist within different mouse strains with regard to the immune response, which may inﬂuence the efﬁcacy of A␤
immunization. With respect to using A␤ deposition as an
endpoint, our studies suggest that in the Tg2576 mouse, A␤
immunization is likely to be more effective in preventing
A␤ deposition than in clearing existing deposits. As clinical
study of A␤ immunization in humans will almost certainly
begin in patients with clinical symptoms of AD, these studies may inﬂuence both the design and interpretation of
human studies, as they imply that immunization may be of
more beneﬁt as a preventative treatment rather than as a
therapeutic treatment.
Further support for the immunization approach has come
from two recent reports that suggest A␤1– 42 immunization
has a beneﬁcial effect on AD-like memory impairment in
different transgenic mouse models of AD [7,11]. These
recent publications have demonstrated that, although somewhat subtle, the behavioral deﬁcits in APP transgenic mice
immunized prior to signiﬁcant A␤ accumulation can be
ameliorated by a therapeutic intervention that targets A␤.
Additional experimentation will be needed to determine
whether behavioral deﬁcits are attenuated by immunization
in transgenic mice with heavy amyloid loads and whether
any behavioral improvements correlates with reduction in
A␤42 that we have observed in this study.
