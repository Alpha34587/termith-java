Objectives: To determine the prevalence of diagnosed
constipation among nursing home patients; to assess
the prevalence of routine (at least one time per week
for 4 consecutive weeks) laxative use; and to investigate prescribing practices.
Design: A retrospective multi-center medical record
evaluation.
Setting: Any one of 25 nursing facilities representative
of a long-term care pharmaceutical provider’s geographical coverage.
Participants: All patients under the age of 65, and/or
who had resided in the facility for less than 4 weeks,
and/or who were placed in a specialty care bed (eg, Alzheimer’s disease, hospice, HIV/AIDS) were excluded.
Results: A total of 712 resident charts meeting initial
inclusion criteria were screened, 392 (55%) of which
had a documented diagnosis of constipation and/or
routine laxative use. Approximately 28% (CI Ϯ 3.3)
of residents had a documented diagnosis of constipation. The rate of laxative use within the same sam-

Although often dismissed as a trivial medical concern,
constipation is a common and often serious problem within
the elderly population. It is frequently associated with a
number of complications, including fecal impaction, stercoral ulceration, bowel obstruction, fecal incontinence,
rectal prolapse, and even syncope.1,2,3,4 Although it is one
of the most common digestive complaints in the United
States overall, its occurrence is highest among persons 65
years old or older.5,6,7 In fact, the prevalence among

ple population of 712 patients was 53.8% (CI Ϯ 3.7).
Of the 392 patients with a diagnosis of constipation
and/or routine laxative use, over 72% had at least
one diagnosis or medication known to precipitate
constipation. The most commonly prescribed laxatives were stool softeners (26.2%), saline laxatives
(18.4%) and stimulant/irritant laxatives (15.6%). Almost half of the laxative users were prescribed more
than one agent.
Conclusion: This study supports the concern that there
is often a gap between documentation of symptoms
and constipation treatment decisions. No correlation
was found between the speciﬁc laxative prescribed
and the presence or absence of a documented diagnosis of constipation. Treatment decisions should be
based on thorough examination and individualized
patient needs. Furthermore, there is a need to increase
monitoring for drug effectiveness. (J Am Med Dir Assoc 2001; 2: 149–154)

Although the prevalence of constipation is in itself an
issue of concern, excessive laxative use among the elderly
further complicates the issue, particularly in the long term
care setting where physician-prescribed laxative use typically far exceeds the prevalence of clinically diagnosed
constipation.3,10,11 This is potentially serious because an
association exists between chronic use of laxatives, stool
softeners, and enemas and signiﬁcant clinical disorders
such as diarrhea,12,13 hypoalbuminemia,11 increased risk of
fecal incontinence and perianal fecal soiling,10,12 and poor
response to bowel preparation for barium enema.14
Commonly, patients who are not clinically constipated
routinely use laxatives because they feel it is important to
have a daily bowel movement.4,15 They consider failure to do
so a quality-of-life issue. Furthermore, up to 75% of institutionalized patients are prescribed laxatives for bowel regulation.10,11,16 Such practices have led to concern regarding the
use, and potential overuse, of laxatives in the elderly populaPhillips et al. 149

tion, and the medical indications (or lack thereof) driving
laxative use.
Given the potential implications of constipation and laxative use in the elderly population, the purpose of this study
was threefold: (1) to determine the prevalence of diagnosed
constipation among the nursing home patients, (2) to assess
the prevalence of routine laxative use, and (3) to investigate
prescribing practices.

weeks, and/or who were placed in a specialty care bed (eg,
Alzheimer’s disease, hospice, HIV/AIDS) were excluded.
Data Collection

In the fall of 1998, researchers conducted a two-part
study that ﬁrst entailed assessing the prevalence of diagnosed constipation and/or routine laxative use among nursing home residents age 65 and over who had resided in the
nursing home for more than 4 weeks.17 Secondly, for those
patients who were classiﬁed as either having a documented
diagnosis of constipation and/or who were receiving routine laxatives, the medical records were further examined
to assess constipation treatment patterns and precipitants
of constipation.

The pharmacists collected demographic information for
each patient, such as gender, age, and payor type, and
indicated whether or not the patient had a documented
diagnosis of constipation within the medical record and/or
routine laxative use. Routine laxative use was deﬁned as a
regular or as needed (PRN) laxative order in which a
laxative had been given at least 1 time per week for at least
4 consecutive weeks. Subjects were not required to have a
diagnosis of constipation or laxative use for the entire
3-month study period (September–November 1998). If the
patient met either of the inclusion criteria (documented
diagnosis of constipation or routine laxative use), the pharmacist further examined the medical record for the following: measurement of treatment patterns, symptoms of constipation, bowel elimination patterns, medication side
effects, and potential precipitants of constipation.

Patient Selection

RESULTS

METHODS

The initial study population included approximately
150,000 geriatric patients residing in 467 skilled nursing facilities in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana,
Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and
Texas. A minimum sample size of 384 patients was required to
provide a parameter point estimate of constipation with 95%
conﬁdence and a range of less than Ϯ 5% (␣ ϭ 0.05 and ␤ ϭ
0.20). The sample size calculation was based on the primary
variable of interest, the proportion of patients within the
eligible population who either used routine laxatives or who
had a documented diagnosis of constipation in the medical
records. The researchers assumed that 50% of patients met
this criterion, which is the most conservative estimate. In
order to ensure precise point estimates during the second
phase of the study, however, the sample size was increased by
100%. Therefore, the ﬁnal desired sample size was 768
patients.
A two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to
ensure feasibility of data collection. From 25 facilities that
were selected from the nursing home sampling frame,
which included all nursing homes serviced on a routine
basis by a consultant pharmacist that agreed to participate
in the collection of data through medical record review, 30
patients were randomly selected. All patients under the age
of 65, and/or who had resided in the facility for less than 4

Demographics
During Phase I, 752 patient records were screened; however, only 712 were included in the analysis. Forty patients did
not meet the initial study inclusion criteria and were therefore
excluded from all analyses (25 were less than 65 years old and
15 had resided in the facility for less than 4 weeks). The
majority of the 712 patients were female (70.9%), 50% of
which were Medicaid recipients. The mean age of female
patients included in the sample was 85 years, slightly higher
than the mean age for males (83 years of age). Based on initial
screening, 55% of the patients (n ϭ 392) had a documented
diagnosis of constipation and/or received routine laxatives.
This cohort of patients did not differ signiﬁcantly from the
original sample in that the majority of the patients were
female (73%) and on Medicaid (52.1%). The mean age of
females in this sample was 86 years of age and for males was
83 years of age. Thirteen (3.3%) patients did not have gender
reported. See Table 1. The remaining 320 who did not meet
the criteria of a diagnosis of constipation and/or routine
laxative use were excluded from Phase II.
Prevalence
The estimated prevalence of diagnosed constipation was
27.5% (CI Ϯ 3.3). The estimated proportion of patients with
routine laxative use, regardless of documented diagnosis, was

53.8%, almost twice the prevalence of documented constipation. Of the 392 patients meeting Phase II inclusion criteria,
2.3% (n ϭ 9) had a diagnosis of constipation without routine
laxative use, 47.7% (n ϭ 187) had a diagnosis of constipation
and routine laxative use, while 50% (n ϭ 196) had documented use of routine laxatives without a documented diagnosis of constipation (see Figure 1).
Almost three-quarters of the patients (n ϭ 285) had at
least one precipitating comorbid condition documented in
the medical record. Approximately 41% (n ϭ 162) had one
documented condition, 24% (n ϭ 95) had two, and 7% (n ϭ
28) had three documented conditions (Table 2). As illustrated in Table 3, the most common comorbid conditions
reported were dementia (n ϭ 168, 42.9%), hypothyroidism (n
ϭ 82, 20.9%) and diabetes mellitus (n ϭ 77, 19.6%). Likewise, approximately three-quarters (n ϭ 304) of the patients
were receiving at least one medication that may have contributed to the occurrence of constipation (Table 2). The
most commonly reported were loop diuretics (n ϭ 94), opioids and iron supplements (n ϭ 70 each), and Caϩϩ antagonists (n ϭ 64) (Table 3). Less than 1% of the patient
medical records contained documentation that explicitly
linked a suspected agent(s) to constipation.
Symptoms of Constipation and Bowel Elimination
Patterns
Approximately 48% of patients (n ϭ 188) had no documented symptoms of constipation recorded during the
3-month time frame. Of the remaining 204 patients, 22% (n
ϭ 88) had one symptom documented, 24% (n ϭ 94) had two,
and 6% (n ϭ 22) had three or more symptoms documented in
the medical records. The three most frequently reported constipation symptoms were hard stools (n ϭ 91, 23.2%), straining (n ϭ 67,17.1%), and incontinence of the bladder (n ϭ
61, 15.6%).
Data collected from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) (Section H #2: Bowel Elimination Pattern) revealed that 25% of
patients (n ϭ 98) had a regular bowel elimination pattern,
12% (n ϭ 48) had a constipated pattern, 5% (n ϭ 20) had
fecal impaction and 1% (n ϭ 4) had episodes of diarrhea
during the 3-month period. The majority of the patients, 53%
(n ϭ 208), had their bowel elimination pattern documented
as “none of the above.” Twenty patients (5%) did not have any

with the largest percentage of patients with a documented
diagnosis of constipation included docusate with casanthranol
(38 of 70 ϭ 54%); lactulose (21 of 49 ϭ 43%); magnesium
hydroxide (50 of 119 ϭ 42%); psyllium (13 of 34 ϭ 38%);
docusate sodium (40 or 123 ϭ 33%). Overall, 57% of patients
receiving constipation therapy did not have a documented
diagnosis of constipation.

Constipation Therapy
Nine of the 392 patients (2.3%) had no documentation of
laxative use during the study period. For the remaining 383
patients (97.7%), a total of 667 laxative prescriptions were
documented. The distribution of laxative therapy by drug
class is illustrated in Figure 2. The three most commonly
prescribed laxatives by drug class were stool softeners (26.2%),
saline laxatives (18.4%) and stimulant/irritant laxatives
(15.6%).
Over one-half (54%) of the patients who received laxative
therapy were prescribed monotherapy, while 46% were receiving two or more agents concomitantly. Of the patients
receiving monotherapy (n ϭ 207), 198 (95.7%) received a
laxative as part of a routine order. The most common laxative
combinations were (1) two routine therapies (15.1%) and (2)
one routine therapy with one prescribed PRN (10.7%). Over
23 speciﬁc products were prescribed for the subjects included
in this sample. Table 4 provides the speciﬁc laxative/constipation therapies prescribed, along with the mean daily doses
and manufacturer’s recommended daily doses. Comparison of
mean daily doses with manufacturer’s recommendations indicates that most prescriptions dispensed were within the manufacturer-recommended dose range. A few exceptions did
exist in that patients receiving methycellulose had subtherapeutic mean daily doses while patients receiving docusate
calcium received doses that exceeded the manufacturer’s recommendations. The number of patients within each drug
category who had a documented diagnosis of constipation
during the 3-month period is also listed. The agents prescribed
most frequently during the 3-month period (deﬁned as Ն 30)

DISCUSSION
The demographic data presented here are similar to other
published research ﬁndings in this population, and are conﬁrmed by results from the 1995 National Nursing Home
Survey.18 Of the 712 patients screened, 196 were reported to
have a documented diagnosis of constipation in their medical
record. This rate translates to an estimated constipation prevalence of 27.5%, which is much lower than the 53.8% of the
patients in the sample routinely using laxatives. Furthermore,
it is important to note that of those patients receiving routine
laxative therapy (n ϭ 383), only 49% had a documented
diagnosis of constipation in the chart. These data suggest that
practitioners may often prescribe laxative therapy for prophylactic purposes and/or fail to document the condition, or, as
part of the blanket standing order, instruct the nurse to give
the patient a laxative upon request.
Over 70% of the 392 patients with a diagnosis of constipation and/or who are receiving routine laxative/constipation
therapy had a condition known to precipitate constipation.
The most common recorded diagnoses in the study sample
were dementia (42.9%), hypothyroidism (20.9%), and diabetes mellitus (19.6%). Furthermore, of those patients with a
diagnosis of constipation and/or receiving laxative therapy,
77.6% were receiving a medication or therapeutic class that
has been reported to cause constipation. Loop diuretics, opioids, iron supplements and calcium antagonists were the most
frequently reported classes with utilization rates of 15.2%,
11.3%, 11.3% and 10.4%, respectively. While the researchers
did not focus on quantifying the relative risk of constipation

associated with speciﬁc drugs or conditions, these descriptive
ﬁndings are consistent with a study conducted by Harari and
colleagues which cited immobility, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes mellitus, and the use of iron supplements, calcium channel
blockers, and antidepressants with moderate to strong anticholinergic activity as statistically signiﬁcant correlates for
regular laxative use.19
Although the medications reported above may contribute
to the diagnosis of constipation and/or need for laxative
therapy, documentation of suspected cause and effect was
noted in fewer than 1% of patients (n ϭ 3). Opioid use was
documented for all three patients. Although opioid-induced
constipation has been substantially discussed in the clinical
literature, data regarding other classes or speciﬁc agents are

not as abundant. These study ﬁndings suggest an opportunity
to increase the awareness of drug-induced constipation
through educational programs for health care professionals.
We found that the stool softener was the most commonly prescribed class, accounting for 26.2% of all orders.
As the stool softeners are primarily used to prevent constipation and are not effective in treating constipation,
particularly in those patients with major causative factors
(eg, opioid use, inadequate dietary ﬁber and ﬂuid intake,
immobility, or uncorrected pathology),20 this may suggest
that physicians are prophylactically prescribing to prevent
constipation.
The saline (18.4%) and stimulant/irritant laxatives (15.6%)
were the second and third most commonly prescribed laxatives.
Phillips et al. 153

Although the stimulant/irritant laxatives (eg, bisacodyl) are not
recommended for regular use on a daily basis due to the potential for severe abdominal cramping and the ﬂuid/electrolyte
abnormalities that may result from chronic use,20 approximately
half of the subjects receiving these agents received them on a
routine basis. Furthermore, only 50% of these patients had a
documented diagnosis of constipation.
Approximately 46% of patients that were prescribed laxative therapy were continuously receiving more than one laxative. This high utilization of combination therapy merits
further investigation as patients may be more appropriately
treated with one agent if doses are optimized and/or if the
therapeutic class is chosen based on constipation etiology.
These ﬁndings may also suggest that constipation is a common disorder necessitating the development of more effective
and better-tolerated drugs that normalize bowel motility.
CONCLUSION
Constipation is a frequent complaint of elderly individuals,
and is a common diagnosis among nursing home residents.
However, prescription of laxative medications is far more
common, and less than half of all patients receiving laxative
medications carry a documented diagnosis of constipation.
Review of medical records reveals that frequently, these medications are prescribed without identifying or attempting to
address underlying precipitating or exacerbating clinical factors, such as other medications, comorbid conditions, and
such “lifestyle” factors as diet, ﬂuid intake, and activity.
Constipation is often dismissed as nonserious and of
little impact on the overall medical management of the
individual and, therefore, is typically deemed a “nursing
function.” However, there is an impact on quality of life. In
fact, studies show that the general well-being of patients
with chronic constipation is lower than that of a comparable normal population and that symptom severity correlates negatively with perceived quality of life.21 Furthermore, current practices in the management of constipation
can lead to polypharmacy, poor monitoring of drug effects,
and a disconnect between who has the symptoms and who
receives treatment. Careful assessment and monitoring can
lead to more effective patient-speciﬁc interventions that
can potentially reduce the burden of symptoms, decrease
the use of unnecessary drugs and their potential adverse
effects, and reduce the total cost of care.
