Abstract
Aging is an independent risk factor for the development of atheroscelrosis, a vascular abnormality
that plays a signiﬁcant role in the development of many cardiovascular disorders. Animal experiments
have demonstrated that aging predisposes the vasculature to advanced atherosclerotic disease and vessel
injury and that this predisposition is a function of age-associated changes in the vessel wall itself. Because
vascular smooth muscle cells play important roles in the pathogenesis of many vascular disorders,
identifying age-associated differences in the way these cells respond to extracellular clues has been an
area of active research. Currently, the most remarkable differences in intracellular signaling between
vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from young and old animals are related to the control of cell
migration through the CamKII pathways and the accelerated transition of older vascular smooth muscle
cells from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype. These differences may be due to alternative
signaling pathways revealed by the inability of older cells to respond to inhibitors, such as transforming
growth factor (TGF)-␤1, or to altered interactions with the extracellular matrix resulting from ageassociated shifts in integrin expression or changes in the matrix composition of blood vessels. The exact
role that these alterations have in explaining age-associated differences in the response of the vessel wall
to injury and its increased susceptibility to developing advanced atherosclerotic lesions remains to be
determined but will be guided by studies on intracellular signaling mechanisms. © 1999 Elsevier

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and a major source of disability
among the elderly population. Vascular abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis, are a
signiﬁcant factor in the development of many cardiovascular diseases. Epidemiological
studies have shown that aging is an independent risk factor for the development of
atherosclerosis (Kannel and Gordon, 1980), a vascular abnormality that plays a signiﬁcant
role in the development of many cardiovascular disorders. Animal experiments, in which
genetic variations are minimized and exposure to atherosclerosis-inducing stimuli can be
precisely controlled, support the notion that aging by itself predisposes the vasculature to
advanced atherosclerotic disease. Spagnoli and colleagues (1991) showed that New
Zealand white rabbits responded differently to a lipid- and cholesterol-rich diet depending
on their age. In particular, younger rabbits developed fewer vascular lesions than their
older counterparts, despite the fact that the duration of exposure to the atherogenic
stimulus was the same and that changes in blood lipid proﬁles due to the diet were also
indistinguishable between the two age groups. In addition, the majority of lesions in older
rabbits were at a signiﬁcantly more advanced stage of development than in the younger
animals. Similar quantitative and qualitative differences in the susceptibility to dietinduced atherosclerosis have been reported in adult and juvenile primates (Weingand et
al., 1986). Together, these results indicate that the higher incidence and greater severity of
vascular lesions in older animals are the result of biological changes in the organism
related to aging.

2. Smooth muscle cells and vascular abnormalities
In its more advanced stages, the atherosclerotic lesion is a complex structure of living
and dead cells, cellular debris, and macromolecular deposits of lipids, extracellular matrix
components, and minerals (reviewed in Bilato and Crow, 1996). Its cellular composition
is likely to consist of blood cells recruited from the circulation, vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs) already present in the intima (the actual site of lesion development in the
vessel-see below), and cells recruited from the underlying medial or adventitial cell layers.
A complete understanding of lesion development, however, is seriously hampered by the
fact that the exact origins of all the cells that comprise these lesions have not been
unambiguously established. A large body of circumstantial evidence, however, suggests
important roles for monocytes recruited from the circulation and VSMCs from the medial
and intimal cell layers (Schwartz et al., 1995; Bilato and Crow, 1996).
The typical arterial vessel wall is composed of three distinct cellular layers. Moving
from luminal side inward, the ﬁrst cellular layer is the intima in which the endothelium
resides. In rats, this is the only layer of cells in the intima throughout most of their adult
life. In other animals, including humans, other cells are also present in the intima and are
located beneath the endothelium. Based on the expression of gene markers, some of these
cells may be of smooth muscle cell origin and are accordingly referred to as intimal
VSMCs (Schwartz et al., 1995). The size of the intima increases dramatically when the
vessel wall is traumatized, such as following mechanical injury inﬂicted by aggressive
inﬂation of a balloon catheter. The exaggerated intima that develops under these conditions is called the neointima. In rats, the neointima consists almost exclusively of
VSMC-like cells, the properties of which are described below. In other animals, including

551

humans, the neointima also involves macrophage and leukocyte inﬁltration (Tanaka et al.,
1993). The intima is separated from the medial cell layer by the internal elastic basal
lamina. The medial layer consists of variable numbers of elastic laminae and medial
VSMCs, each cell being surrounded by an individual basement membrane (Pauly et al.,
1992). The medial cell layer is separated from the adventitial cell layer, which contains
ﬁbroblast-like cells and blood vessels, by the external elastic lamina.
In the intact vessel, medial VSMCs are relatively quiescent with respect to proliferation
and are highly specialized as contractile cells to control lumen diameter and thereby
regulate blood ﬂow in response to nervous, hormonal, and local inﬂuences. When these
cells are isolated from the vessel and placed in cell culture, they gradually lose their
specialized or differentiated properties and become proliferative and highly motile. In
addition, the cells’ gene expression and protein synthesis machinery are redirected from
the production of specialized contractile elements to that of supporting cell proliferation
and extracellular matrix deposition. This process of switching from the contractile/
differentiated mode to a proliferating/synthetic cell type has been given the name,
phenotypic modulation (Campbell and Campbell, 1990). The switch from the contractile
to the synthetic phenotype begins as soon as medial VSMCs are isolated from the intact
vessel. The process can be somewhat delayed by manipulating the extracellular environment of the isolated VSMCs when they are placed in cell culture. This suggests that the
unique features of the extracellular environment of medial VSMCs including their association with an organized elastin matrix and the individual basement membrane surrounding each cell is responsible, in part, for inducing or maintaining the contractile phenotype
(Thyberg et al., 1990). Attempts to return synthetic VSMCs to the contractile phenotype
by embedding them in reconstituted basement membranes have been only partially
successful (Pauly et al., 1992). It is of some interest and possible relevance that medial
VSMCs isolated from the vessels of older animals modulate to the synthetic state more
rapidly than those isolated from younger animals (Bilato and Crow, 1996).
The role that phenotypic modulation plays in vascular abnormalities and the vessel
wall’s response to trauma, however, is questionable. Smooth actin-positive cells can be
found in atherosclerotic lesions and are abundantly present in human restenotic lesions or
the neointima caused by balloon catheter injury in animals (Schwartz et al., 1995), an
experimental model for human restenosis. Are these cells synthetic medial VSMCs that
have migrated into the lesions from the media? In the case of neointima that forms in
response to vessel injury, the answer seems to be no. Although both synthetic medial
VSMCs and neointimal VSMCs are non-contractile and proliferate when placed in cell
culture, they exhibit strikingly different morphological features and patterns of gene
expression (see Schwartz et al., 1995; Pauly et al., 1998). Furthermore, these differences
are maintained in culture for many generations, indicating that these phenotypes are not
readily interconvertible.
Cells with some of the characteristics of neointimal VSMCs can be isolated as a minor
subpopulation from the medial cell layer (Bochaton–Piallat et al., 1996), suggesting that
these are cells preferentially recruited to the intima upon injury. This be a necessary step
for neointimal formation in the balloon injured vessels of young adult rats, since the intima
in these animals consists solely of the endothelium and its underlying basement membrane. It is also likely to occur in other animals, including man, since balloon catheter
inﬂation or vessel atherectomy generally removes the complete intima. Interestingly,
medial VSMCs isolated from arterial vessels of late embryonic or fetal rats are virtually
indistinguishable from neointimal VSMCs (Majesky et al., 1992). Neointimal VSMCs

552

may, therefore, arise either from a minor subpopulation of VSMCs in the media that have
retained fetal characteristics or from the general population of medial VSMCs that have
reverted to the fetal phenotype upon injury of the vessel. Reversion to a fetal phenotype
in response to cellular stress has been noted in many different cell types, including
cardiomyocytes (reviewed in Crow et al., 1996). What makes neointimal/intimal VSMCs
unique in this regard is that the phenotype is stable and persists both in vivo and in cell
culture.

3. Age-associated differences in VSMC signaling during the response to
vessel injury
Experiments published more than 10 years ago established that the response to vessel
injury is much greater in vessels of older animals (Hariri et al., 1986). In these studies, two
types of vessel injury were compared. In the ﬁrst, the vessel underwent severe mechanical
injury caused by the rapid and repeated overinﬂation of a balloon catheter. This manipulation resulted in endothelial denudation, platelet binding and activation at the denuded
interface, and massive mechanical injury to the underlying medial cell layer resulting in
rupture of the elastic laminae and medial cell death. Vessels from either young or old
animals mounted a similar response to this type of injury and produced a large neointima
at the site of injury.
The second type of injury involved gently denuding the vessel of its endothelial cell
layer with a ﬁne wire coil. This injury resulted in platelet binding and activation to the
denuded vessel wall but produced no signiﬁcant injury to the underlying medial cell layer.
Under these circumstances, the response of younger versus older vessels were markedly
different. Vessels in young animals failed to show an increased intima, while vessels in
older animals displayed a neointima similar to that seen with the more invasive balloon
catheter injury. Subsequent experiments in which vessels from young and old animals
were transplanted into different aged hosts established that the age-associated differences
in the response to injury were intrinsic to the vessel and unaffected by the age of the donor.
One explanation for the differences in responsiveness between young and old vessels
has emerged from further analyses of the response to balloon catheter injury in younger
animals. These studies established that both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) are required for the development of the neointima
(Lindner et al., 1991). The source of PDGF is activated platelets adhering to the denuded
vessel wall, whereas bFGF is released by mechanical stress to VSMCs residing in the
media. Infusion of neutralizing antibodies to either PDGF or bFGF blocks neointimal
development in response to balloon injury in young animals (Ferns et al., 1991; Lindner
et al., 1991). In young vessels, therefore, gentle denudation is not sufﬁcient to evoke
neointimal development because there is no bFGF release from the medial cell layer.
Subsequently, it has been shown that infusion of bFGF, though itself not enough to elicit
neointimal development, enabled young vessels to develop such lesions following gentle
denudation (Lindner et al., 1991).
Cell culture experiments examining the role of bFGF in PDGF-directed chemotaxis of
VSMCs from our laboratory have provided a possible mechanism for this dual growth
factor requirement (Bilato et al., 1995). These studies demonstrated that, although bFGF
itself was not a chemoattractant, it was required for PDGF to activate the enzyme,
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII). Activation of this enzyme was

M.S. Lundberg, M.T. Crow / Experimental Gerontology 34 (1999) 549 –557

553

previously shown by the laboratory to be required for PDGF-directed migration of
VSMCs isolated from young adult rats and to be an important point of integration for
cellular signals and interaction with the environment (Pauly et al., 1995). The signaling
requirements for PDGF-directed migration in VSMCs isolated from “older” rats (18 –20
months), however, was quite different than that characterized in the “young” VSMCs and
utilized a mechanism that did not require CamKII activation. Consequently, the migration
of these VSMCs toward PDGF was unaffected by inhibitors of CamKII and neutralizing
antibodies to bFGF (Crow and Bilato, 1996). These results suggested that the difference
in the response of young and old rats to gentle arterial endothelium denudation was due,
in part, to the fact that the signaling pathway regulating migration of VSMCs from older
animals was able to bypass the requirement for CamKII activation and, therefore, the need
for bFGF release from the underlying medial VSMCs. How older VSMCs are able to
bypass this obligatory integration point is unclear and may involve changes in expression
of inhibitors of migration, such as transforming growth factor (TGF) ␤ (see below), or
different patterns of integrin expression.
Integrins have been shown to be critical for regulating intracellular signaling pathways
governing complex biological functions, such as cell migration and proliferation. This last
consideration may of particularly importance to emerging therapies for the treatment of
vascular disorders based on integrin blockade. One of these involves inhibition of ␤3
integrin function, which is thought to target not only thrombolytic events via the ␣IIb␤3
receptor on platelets, but also VSMC function through its ␣v␤3 receptor. We recently
showed that PDGF-migration of VSMCs was inhibited by antagonists of the ␣v␤3 receptor
and involved ␣v␤3 regulation (via bFGF) of CamKII activation (Bilato et al., 1997). Not
surprisingly, migration of VSMCs isolated from old rats was unaffected by these antagonists (Bilato and Crow, 1996). If these results in the rat are applicable to humans, then
the effectiveness of anti-␣v␤3 therapy may signiﬁcantly reduce vascular disorders in the
elderly.
Other changes in VSMC may also play a role in the enhanced responsiveness of older
vessels to injury. Older VSMCs express more PDGF receptors (Sarzani et al., 1991) and
migrate at a signiﬁcantly greater rate than VSMCs isolated from young adult rats (Li et al.,
1997). In addition, although earlier studies concentrated on examining the role for CamKII
in the regulation of VSMC function, it is now clear from numerous studies that activation
of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), erk1/2, are also important for PDGFstimulated migration (Graf et al., 1997; Lundberg et al., 1998). Our laboratory has shown
further that MAPK-mediated cell migration occurs through both CamKII-dependent and
-independent mechanisms (Lundberg et al., 1998). About half of all cellular MAPK
activity generated by mitogens is microtubule-associated (Reszka et al., 1995), which is
thought to phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins, such as tau (Drewes et al.,
1992). This, in turn, may destabilize microtubules and promote cell movement. Ageassociated changes in cytoskeletal proteins occur, and of particular interest, is the upregulation of tubulin, a major component of microtubules (Li et al., 1997). Based on the
current data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that age-related increases in tubulin and
VSMC migration may allow a shift in the signal transduction pathway toward MAPKmediated microtubule destabilization and away from that regulated by CamKII activation.
VSMCs from older animals are also relatively insensitive to the inhibitory inﬂuences
of TGF-␤1. These VSMCs exhibit a reduced capacity to bind TGF-␤1 on the cell surface
and an increased ability to actively degrade it (McCaffrey and Falcone, 1993). The
mechanism(s) underlying this age-associated defect is unknown, but it has been shown

554

M.S. Lundberg, M.T. Crow / Experimental Gerontology 34 (1999) 549 –557

that VSMCs from human atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions can acquire resistance to
the anti-proliferative effects of TGF␤1 as a result of the selective loss of functional type
II receptors (McCaffrey et al., 1995). Because expression of type I receptors are unaffected and these receptors are preferentially involved in extracellular matrix production,
the response of these cells to TGF␤1 switches from growth arrest to increased ﬁbrosis and
uncontrolled growth. Transfection of type II receptors restores the anti-proliferative
response in cultured cells, suggesting that intracellular signaling pathways associated with
these receptors are intact. More recently, this selective loss in type II TGF-␤ receptors in
atherosclerotic lesions has been attributed to microsatellite instability (McCaffrey et al.,
1997). Loss of growth control through a genetic mechanism may account for the monoclonal expansion that has been observed in human atherosclerotic lesions (see Schwartz et
al., 1995). It is unlikely, however, to account for the age-associated differences seen in
response to mechanical vessel injury, unless a signiﬁcant fraction of cells in the vessel
wall have already undergone mutation before the injury is induced.

4. Changes in the vascular wall with aging that may affect VSMC signaling
and responsiveness
Though intimal thickening can be experimentally induced by trauma, it also occurs
during the normal course of vessel aging. In rats, the intima increases up to ﬁvefold
compare to young animals. This increase is due predominantly to the accumulation of
VSMCs as well as monocytes (Guyton et al., 1983; Li et al., 1999). Both of these cells
types are absent from the intima of young rats, which contains only the endothelium and
its underlying basement membrane support. A similar thickening of the tunica intima has
been reported in humans (Virmani et al., 1991). Thickening of the intima due to VSMC
accumulation is likely signiﬁcant, since regions of intimal thickening are prone to the
development of atherosclerosis (reviewed in Schwartz et al., 1995).
Changes in the structural architecture of the vessel wall also occur with aging and these
changes may be important factors in age-associated increase in the the overall increase in
the intima. Extracellular matrix reorganization occurs with aging, such that the volume
density of collagen increases with age, whereas that of elastin decreases (Forneri et al.,
1992). In addition, collagen ﬁbrils become organized into multi-branched bundles,
whereas elastin ﬁbers, which are organized as thick and continuous lamella early in adult
life, become disorganized, thinner, and often fragmented with age (Guyton et al., 1983;
Forneri et al., 1992). These changes in the relative content and organization of collagen
and elastin result in increased ﬁbrosis and contribute to the stiffening of the vascular wall
(Lakatta, 1993), an event associated with hypertrophy and the eventual heart failure. The
changes in TGF␤ responsiveness described above may be partially responsible for this
shift toward increased ﬁbrosis with aging. In addition, increased TGF␤ expression has
recently been demonstrated in aging vessels (Li et al., 1999).
Changes in elastin biosynthesis and degradation are also likely to play an important role
in vascular remodeling and intracellular signaling with aging. Recent genetic studies in
which the elastin gene had been deleted from the mouse genome resulted in extensive
intimal thickening, indicating that the importance of elastin extends beyond its role in
stabilizing arterial structure to regulating VSMCs proliferation and migration during
development (Li et al., 1998). Fragmentation and loss of elastin may have similar if not
as dramatic effects. Both the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, which interferes with

555

elastin assembly as can the proteolytic degradation of elastin by elastases and metalloproteinases increase with aging (Li et al., 1999). In addition, it has been shown that elastin
fragments can act as speciﬁc ligands for receptor-mediated signaling in cells (Senior et al.,
1984).
Paralleling the increase in TFG␤1 levels in the aging vasculature are marked increases
in ﬁbronectin levels (Li et al., 1999). These changes undoubtedly contribute to the shift
from an elastic to a ﬁbrotic/stiff vessel. Fibronectin also accelerates the switch from
contractile to synthetic phenotype that occurs when medial VSMCs are placed in culture
(Thyberg et al., 1990). Interestingly, both ﬁbronectin and TGF-␤ expression are regulated
by angiotensin II and chronic administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors substantially reduce and delay many of the age-associated extracellular matrix
and intimal changes described above (Michel et al., 1994). Whether ACE inhibition would
affect the response of such “rejuvenated” older vessels to injury is not known but would
be valuable in sorting out whether changes in VSMC intracellular signaling pathways with
aging are the cause or effect of vessel wall alterations with aging.
Finally, another factor that may affect VSMC signaling with advancing age are the
effects of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). AGEs are the products of nonenzymatic but irreversible glycation and oxidation of proteins and lipids (reviewed in
Schmidt et al., 1994). AGEs accumulate on proteins with long half lives, such as collagen
and elastin, and occur at an accelerated rate in diabetes. AGEs exert their effects on
vascular cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Indirectly, they can modify
and crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to increased stiffness of the vessel
with age. Directly, they induce a pro-oxidant stress on the cell through a variety of cell
surface receptors (Yan et al., 1994). One of these is a member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily, referred to as RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts). Expression of RAGE is elevated in atherosclerotic lesions and in the neointima that forms in
response to vessel injury (Crow et al., 1999). AGE-RAGE interactions lead to a proinﬂammatory pattern of gene expression which is likely to contribute to and exacerbate
atherosclerotic lesion development. The development of reagents to block AGE-RAGE
interactions and AGE formation will undoubtedly help determine the relative importance
of AGEs and RAGE to all vascular abnormalities and especially those whose incidence is
markedly elevated in aging vessels.

5. Discussion
Currently, the most remarkable differences in intracellular signaling between VSMCs
isolated from young and old animals are related to the control of cell migration through
the CamKII pathways and the accelerated transition of older VSMCs from the contractile
to the synthetic phenotype. These differences may be due to alternative signaling pathways revealed by the inability of older VSMCs to respond to inhibitors, such as TGF-␤1,
or to altered interactions with the extracellular matrix resulting from age-associated shifts
in integrin expression. The exact role that these alterations have in explaining ageassociated differences in the response of the vessel wall to injury and its increased
susceptibility to developing advanced atherosclerotic lesions remains to be determined but
will be guided by such studies on intracellular signaling mechanisms.
