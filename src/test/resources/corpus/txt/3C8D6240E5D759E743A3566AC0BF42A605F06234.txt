Abstract
In the fungal aging model Podospora anserina, lifespan is controlled by mitochondrial and
nuclear genetic traits. Different nuclear genes are known to affect the integrity of the mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA). One gene of this type is Grisea encoding a copper-modulated transcription factor
involved in the control of cellular copper homeostasis. The characterization of a long-lived mutant
with a loss-of-function mutation in this gene revealed that the last step in the pathway, homologous
recombination, leading to the characteristic age-related mtDNA reorganizations is copper-dependent. In growing parts of the culture, the stabilization of the mtDNA has an important impact on the
biogenesis of functional mitochondria, on their capacity to remodel damaged respiratory chains and
on longevity. q 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction
Experimental aging research using the ®lamentous fungus Podospora anserina as a
model system has a long tradition. Already in the early 1950s, Rizet reported that all wild
isolates of this fungus, in contrast to almost all other ®lamentous fungi, senesce after
prolonged vegetative propagation (Rizet, 1953). During aging, the growth rate of the
culture, the so-called mycelium, decreases and the pigmentation changes. Finally, the
®lamentous ªcellsº of the mycelium, the hyphae, die at their tips. Extensive analyses of
this ªsenescence syndromeº revealed that it is under the control of both environmental as

Fig. 1. Instability of the mtDNA of P. anserina as the result of homologous recombination between direct repeats.
(A) Transposition of the pl-intron to either an ectopic site or to the site downstream of the ®rst CoxI exon leads to
the generation of dispersed or tandem repeats of the pl-intron. The acceptor site of the intron in the CoxI gene is
indicated by IBS (intron binding site), the sequence at the ectopic site by IBS p (intron-like binding site).
Recombination processes between duplicated sequences lead to the generation of different mtDNA subcircles.
(B) Recombination processes between dispersed short direct repeats of a particular region of the mtDNA result in
the formation of b-senDNAs (Jamet-Vierny et al., 1997). This circular DNA species contains a central common
region containing an origin (Ori) of replication and variable ¯anking sequences.

well as genetic factors. Nuclear genes and extranuclear genetic traits were found to be
involved (Marcou, 1961; Esser and Keller, 1976; Tudzynski and Esser, 1979). A covalently closed circular DNA species, named plDNA or a-sen DNA, was identi®ed as the
extranuclear component (Stahl et al., 1978; Cummings et al., 1979a). In juvenile cultures,
plDNA is an integral part of the high molecular weight mtDNA and represents the ®rst
È
intron (pl-intron) of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (CoxI) (Kuck et al., 1981;
Osiewacz and Esser, 1984). During aging, the pl-intron becomes liberated and ampli®ed.
At the same time, large parts of the mtDNA are deleted. These reorganizations occur

almost quantitatively since in senescent cultures most mtDNA molecules are extensively
È
rearranged (Kuck et al., 1981).
It is striking that senescent cultures of all investigated geographical races, wild-type
È
strains collected from different regions of Europe, contain ampli®ed plDNA (Kuck et al.,
1985a). In contrast, various long-lived mutants were reported which either do not contain
ampli®ed plDNA or the ampli®cation of this genetic element is delayed (Tudzynski et al.,
È
1982; Vierny et al., 1982; Kuck et al., 1985b; Schulte et al., 1988; Osiewacz et al., 1989).
Taken together, the data suggested a signi®cant or even a causative role of plDNA in aging
of P. anserina.

2. Transposition of the mobile intron leads to increased mtDNA instabilities
The pl-intron contains an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a protein with signi®cant homology to mRNA maturases and reverse transcriptases (Osiewacz and Esser, 1984;
Michel and Lang, 1985). Overexpression of this ORF led to a demonstration of a reverse
transcriptase activity of the pl-intron encoded protein (Fassbender et al., 1994). Moreover,
the same activity was identi®ed in crude extracts of middle-aged Podospora cultures
(Steinhilber and Cummings, 1986). The identi®cation of a stable splicing intermediate,
an RNA forming a lariat structure (Schmidt et al., 1990), together with the demonstration
of a pl-intron copy at a position at which this sequence normally does not occur, led to the
suggestion that this intron is able to transpose. One hypothetical model explains this
process to proceed via reverse transcription of a pl-RNA intermediate followed by the
integration of the resulting DNA into the mtDNA (Sellem et al., 1993). As an alternative to
this ªreverse splicingº process, the pl-intron transposition was suggested to occur after the
generation of a double strand break at the acceptor site and a replication process using the
pl-intron RNA as a template (Sainsard-Chanet et al., 1994). Integration of the pl-intron
either occurs directly downstream of the ®rst CoxI exon or at an ectopic acceptor site. As a
consequence, additional copies of the 2.5 kbp intron sequence can be found in tandem as
well as dispersed in the same mtDNA molecule (Fig. 1A) (Sellem et al., 1993; Borghouts
et al., 2000). Subsequent homologous recombination processes between these duplicated
sequences appear to account for the formation of plDNA molecules and to various mtDNA
subcircles generated during aging. Depending on whether or not these circles contain a
functional origin of replication they are retained or become lost (Fig. 1A).
In addition to homologous recombination processes between duplicated copies of the
pl-intron, recombination between short endogenous direct repeats plays a signi®cant role
in the reorganization of the mtDNA regularly occurring during senescence of P. anserina
cultures. Again, if these sequences contain a functional origin of replication, they can be
isolated as stable mtDNA subcircles. The most prominent circle of this type is the so called
b-senDNA, a DNA species of variable size which often, but not systematically, accumulates in P. anserina cultures (Cummings et al., 1979b; Cummings et al., 1985; JametVierny et al., 1997). Size variability of these circles is due to the presence of different pairs
of short direct repeats located adjacent to the internal ªcommon regionº of this sequence
(Fig. 1B) (Jamet-Vierny et al., 1997).

Fig. 2. Different pathways leading to mtDNA rearrangements steps in P. anserina. Repeated sequences are either present as short endogenous repeats in the mtDNA or are
generated as the result of the transposition of the mobile pl-intron. Transposition of the intron is thought to proceed via the expression of the CoxI gene (CoI), reverse
transcription of a pl-RNA intermediate and integration into the IBS site in the CoxI gene (homing-like transposition) or into an IBS p site at an ectopic site in the mtDNA.
The last step in this pathway, recombination between homologous sequences, is dependent on the availability of copper. In mutant grisea, this step is affected.

3. mtDNA instability is dependent on copper
The selection of nuclear mutants in which the lifespan is modi®ed raised the
intriguing question whether these mutations affect age-related mitochondrial functions. Interestingly, in the three independently selected nuclear mutants grisea, as65, and su12-C1 life is extended but ®nite although these mutants do not amplify
plDNA (Borghouts et al., 1997; Silar et al., 1997). In addition, recently a mitochondrial mutant was characterized in which the pl-intron is precisely deleted. Consequently, no plDNA can be ampli®ed. Although characterized by a twofold increased
lifespan, the mutant senesces (Begel et al., 1999). Collectively, these data indicate
that the ampli®cation of plDNA is not a prerequisite for aging but that this mobile
genetic element is able to modulate the rate of aging.
One intriguing question arising from the characteristics of the above mentioned
nuclear mutants relates to the molecular mechanisms leading to the stabilization of
the mtDNA. At present, the answer is not clear in all cases. However, some insight
is derived from the characterization of long-lived mutant grisea. These analyses
revealed that grisea is a copper-uptake mutant (Marbach et al., 1994; Borghouts
et al., 1997; Borghouts et al., 2000). Copper-uptake is affected due to a loss-offunction mutation in nuclear gene Grisea. The product of this gene is a coppermodulated transcription factor involved in cellular copper homeostasis (Osiewacz
and Nuber, 1996; Borghouts et al., 1997; Borghouts and Osiewacz, 1998). It senses
cellular copper levels and controls the expression of a high-af®nity copper transporter gene. Due to the mutation in Grisea, this transporter is not expressed resulting in
reduced cellular copper levels.
Since the mtDNA is stabilized in this mutant, mtDNA reorganizations appear to
be dependent on the availability of copper. However, which one of the different
steps introduced above (Fig. 2) are dependent on the presence of this metal? A
systematic analysis of the corresponding pathway revealed that the transcription of
the CoxI gene as the ®rst step in the transposition via an RNA intermediate and
reverse transcription is not affected in the mutant and thus is copper-independent
(Borghouts et al., 2000). The existence of a copper-dependent transcriptional control
was rather likely since such a control was previously demonstrated for a number of
other genes encoding copper-binding proteins like Cu/Zn dismutase, metallothionein,
and plastocyanin (Hamer, 1986; Carri et al., 1991; Hill et al., 1991; Thiele 1992;
È
Steinkuhler et al., 1994; Hill and Michalczyk, 1995). Also the next step, the transposition of the pl-intron to the ectopic site as well as to the CoxI gene (ªhominglikeº transposition) was found to be independent of copper. In PCR experiments the
transposed pl-intron sequences was identi®ed at both sites in the wild-type strain
and in the grisea mutant. In marked contrast, there was a signi®cant difference in
the generation of b-sen DNA molecules in cultures of the wild-type strain and the
mutant grown in standard growth medium. Whereas b-sen DNA, generated by
homologous recombination between short direct repeats (Fig. 1B), was frequently
found to accumulate in the wild-type strain, this was not the case in the mutant.
Supplementation of the growth medium with additional copper reverted this mutant
phenotype to wild-type characteristics. Under these conditions, the cellular copper

Fig. 3. A functional mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of components encoded by both, the nuclear and
the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). During aging, the mtDNA of the wild-type becomes extensively reorganized. Large parts of the mtDNA are deleted. Consequently, mitochondria are unable to remodel components of
the respiratory chain which were damaged by ROS. Moreover, division of these mitochondria results in the
multiplication of dysfunctional mitochondria. These organelles accumulate at the growth front of senescent
P.anserina cultures.

level in the mutant appears to be normalized via the uptake of copper by low
af®nity copper transporters. Collectively, the data suggest a copper-dependence of
the homologous recombination process in mitochondria of P. anserina and an indirect effect of the nuclear gene Grisea on the stability of the mtDNA.
Apart from the effect on the integrity of the mtDNA, a decrease in cellular copper has a
number of additional consequences. First, copper-de®ciency leads to a defect in mitochondrial energy transduction since the cytochrome oxidase of the respiratory chain requires
copper as a cofactor. This defect leads to the induction of an alternative, cytochrome
oxidase independent respiratory pathway (Osiewacz and Kimpel, 1999). Second, the
generation of aggressive reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Fenton chemistry appears
to be reduced. Third, the activity of copper-dependent enzymes other than COX is
affected. Some of them, like laccase, tyrosinase, or the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase,

683

may be of relevance in respect to longevity since they are either involved in the generation
of ROS or are part of a defense system directed against oxidative stress.
4. Mitochondrial dysfunction as the result of mtDNA instabilities
During vegetative propagation P. anserina cultures grow continuously by extension and
branching of the hyphal tips at the growth front. After a strain speci®c growth period, it is
this area of a culture that becomes senescent. In this region, mitochondria are severely
affected in their energy transduction machinery. What are the reasons for this phenotype?
The available experimental data suggest the following scenario (Fig. 3). During growth,
the newly formed parts of the mycelium need to obtain a suf®cient number of functional
mitochondria to meet their energy demands. Mitochondria are generated by division. In
older cultures, the generation of functional mitochondria is not possible since the mtDNA
encoding 13 proteins of the respiratory chain, 2 subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes, and
25 tRNAs (Cummings et al., 1990) is extensively rearranged. Consequently, at the growth
front of older cultures, dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate. If, for any reason, the
mtDNA remains stable over time, the generation of functional mitochondria is possible.
Intact mtDNA is not only important in the growing part of the mycelium at the hyphal
tips but also in areas not growing any more. Here, molecular damage necessarily occurs
over time since ROS are continuously generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
Remodeling of respiratory chains damaged by ROS is only possible when nuclear encoded
as well as mitochondrial encoded subunits are available (Fig. 3). In addition, severely
damaged mitochondria may be degraded and replaced by new and functional organelles.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In P. anserina cellular copper has an impact on the integrity of the mtDNA. A nuclear
gene Grisea involved in the control of copper homeostasis indirectly affects mtDNA
stability. Also in other systems, the integrity of the mtDNA is controlled by nuclear
genes and their gene products. In humans, a role of topoisomerase II was suggested in
the generation of large-scale deletions found in patients with clinical characteristics of
external opthalomoplegia (PEO) or Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS). Putative topoisomerase II sites were identi®ed in the vicinity of mtDNA breakpoints (Mita et al., 1990; Blok
et al., 1995). These sequences may predispose certain parts of the mtDNA to deletions. In
Neurospora crassa, another ®lamentous ascomycete, the nuclear nd gene was found to be
involved in recombination events between short direct repeats of the mtDNA (SeidelRogol et al., 1989; Bertrand et al., 1993). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sitespeci®c endonuclease Endo.SceI, encoded by a nuclear and a mitochondrial gene, was
reported to induce homologous recombination of the mtDNA between direct repeats
(Nakagawa et al., 1991; Nakagawa et al., 1992). Finally, the accumulation of diverse
mtDNA deletions in patients with Wilson's disease, an inherited disease characterized
by the accumulation of copper in liver mitochondria, also suggests a link between cellular
copper, oxidative stress and mtDNA instability (Mansouri et al., 1997). It is very likely
that many other nuclear genes are involved in maintenance of the mtDNA and thus

represent important factors of the complex nuclear-mitochondrial network involved in
lifespan control. It will be of interest to unravel the details of the molecular basis and
the underlying mechanisms of this network and to see whether similar pathways are
operating in the different biological systems.
