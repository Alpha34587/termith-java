and clinical practice. Early diagnosis may
enhance maximuln effectiveness of remedial treatn1ent efforts designed to con1pensate for the progressive deterioration that is
characteristic of this disease. Individuals
with mild dementia and healthy older adults
can be distinguished using psychometric
Inethods. 11-13 However, there is a high degree of overlap in the performance of patients with very lnild dementia and both
healthy control subjects and those with mild
dementia of the Alzheimer type (OAT). 2
This finding indicates that the absolute levels of perfonnance on psycholnetric tests
alone is not helpful in identifying very mild
clementia.
Because good collateral informants are
often not available to provide inforn1ation
on past performance, indicators of earlier
levels of performance are used instead in
research on aging (e.g., "hold" tests of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WArS],
such as the Infonnation subtest). I-Iowever,
these indicators may also be affected by
dementia. Because of this important scientific limitation, Storandt and I-lilF called for
a national effort sinlilar to that of baseline
mammogralns used in the later detection of
breast cancer to get baseline levels of psychOlnetric perfonuance while people are in
their midyears. A different approach to this
diagnostic problem is the inclusion of different levels of assessment in the identification
of very mild denlentia, a solution that has
been proposed by Berrios. 14 Subjective
complaints of the patient, impairments in
activities of daily living (ADL), and psychiatric symptoms are noncognitive variables
that may indicate early stages of dementia.
It is true that many of these changes are
psychologically complex and difficult to assess; nevertheless these symptoms are likely
to carry information that may suggest early
stages of dementia. 14
The purpose of the present study was
twofold. We first hypothesized that the discrimination of very mild dementia from normal aging and from mild-to-moderate DAT
would benefit from the inclusion of differTI·IE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GEIUATRIC PSYCHIATRY

ent levels of assessment. Second, we
wanted to know which noncognitive variables would best distinguish between
healthy control subjects, patients with nlildto-moderate DAT, and patients with very
mild dementia.

MEmODS
Subjects
All participants in the study were initially evaluated at the Berlin Memory Clinic
and participated in our long-term study of
clelnentia. 15 The Clinical Dementia Rating
Scale (CDR),16 the Global Deterioration
Scale (GDS),17 the lvIini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),18 and the Clinical Global
Impression (CGI)19 were used to assign patients and control subjects to the different
groups.
Diagnostic criteria are shown in Table
1. DAT patients had to fulfill DSM-III-R20
criteria for delnentia and NINCDS/ADRDA
criteria2J for probable Alzheimerts disease
(AD). Criteria for patients with very mild
dementia were comparable to those of Berg
and coworkers,22 which have been proven
to be reliable in follow-up studies' and by
means of pathology verification.? Diagnosis
and staging were performed by case conferences attended by all four participating
physicians after all information was collected. Because the physicians were responsible for both the medical and the
neuropsychological assessment, they were
not blind with respect to the diagnoses.
There were 53 participants (20 men, 33
women; mean age == 71.74 ± 6.42 years) included in the analyses (Table 2). Seventeen
had mild-to-moderate OAT (6 men, 11
women; mean age = 74.8 ± 6.1 years); 18
had very mild dementia (5 men, 13 women;
nlean age = 70.4 ± 8.1 years); and 18 were
healdlY control subjects (9 men, 9 women;
mean age = 69.8 ± 3.5 years). There were
nonsignificant trends for the control group

Psychopathological Assessment
The AGP-system 23 is an extensive
standardized docunlentation systenl for psychopathology. In its structure it is mainly
based on the AMDP systenl,2~ with some
Inodifications to meet the needs of a gerontopsychiatric population. Only psychopathological alterations that were present in
at least 15% of the sanlple were used in this
study. The Montgomery Asberg Depression

Neuropsychological Assessment
The "Mlinchner Verbaler GecHichtnistest" (MVG) (Ilmberger, 1988)27 is an
experin1ental Gennan adaption of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT),28 which
consists of five learning trials of a 16-word
target list and several different recall and
recognition tasks. To assess verbal fluency
(Verbal Fluency Test, VFT) we used a letter
fluency task. 29 To assess nonverbal learning
and melnoty, we used three tests of the
Gernlan version of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battety
(CANTAB).30 These tests are cOlnprehensive
in teflns of the range of functions they
assess, and they have been shown to be
sensitive to deficits as well as to progressive
decline in patients early in the course of
DAT31t 32 and Parkinson's disease. 33 •34 Also,
many of these tests have recently been used
to assess performance in neurosurgical patients with localized lesions of the frontal
and temporal lobes. 35 •36 The stimuli were
generated by microcomputer (Acorn BBe
Personal Computer) and presented on a
14-inch mediuln resolution color monitor
(Microvitec) fitted with a touch screen.
Three different areas of nonverbal learning
and memory were assessed: 1) Visuospatial
memory (CANTAB-STAR-POSITION); 2) Visual pattern menlory CCANTAB-STARSHAPE); 3) Conditional learning in a
delayed response paradigm (CANTABDREP).

Subjective Complaints
Subjective cOlnplaints of the participants were recorded if they could be attached to the following cognitive areas:
Inenl0ry, orientation, thinking and higher
cortical functioning (praxis, speech, gnosis).

Variables that did not significantly (at P
~ 0.05) predict group nlembership were excluded fronl further analyses to reduce the
large nU111ber of variables. There were 55
variables left for group comparisons of DAT
patients and patients with very lnild dementia, 14 for the group comparisons of patients
with very Inild denlentia and control subjects, and 21 for the group cOluparisons of
DAT patients and control subjects. Because
control subjects did not have psychiatric
abnormalities (see Table 1) there are no
clata fro111 the psychopathological level of
assesslnent for analyses. All cOlnputations
were perfornled with SPSS-PC, Version
4.01. 36

Behavioral Assessment (IADL)
To assess "instru111ental activities of
daily living," (IADL) we used the classic
scale of Lawton and Brody37 and added five
ADL dill1ensions (orientation, luenl0ry, attention, social interaction, and engagelTIent)
taken froln the Multidimensional Obselvation Scale for Elderly Subjects38 and the
Multilevel AsseSSll1ent Instrull1ent. 39

Statistical Analysis
Because the required assunlptions for
linear cliscrinlinant analysis (nlultivariate
nornlality of the independent variable, with
equal variance and covariance ll1atrices in
the two groups) were not fullfilled in our
sanlple, logistic regression analysis40 was
lIsed to identify the variables that discrinlinate best between groups. We used the
forward stepwise variable selection

at 0.10. The chi-square statistic of the

considered separately for classification. Second, we report the variables that best predicted group luembership when all sets of
variables were considered sinluitaneously.
The results of logistic regression analyses
and descriptive statistics will be shown in
detail only for the analyses where all participants were classified correctly.
DAT vs. Very Mild Dementia
Psychopathological variables as well as
variables describing IADLs correctly predicted group Inelnbership for 97.1 % of
cases. Neuropsychological variables correctly classified 94.20/0 of cases. Subjective
cOlnplaints were not llseful; none of these
variables nlade a significant contribution in
predicting group menlbership (see Table 3).
When all sets of variables were used
sinlultaneously, three variables were
needed to correctly classify all cases. Two
of these variables were verbal learning
items; the third was a psychopathological
variable. At the first step, logistic regression
analysis included the AGP variable "Distur-

bances of Apperception" in the model, and
91.4% of patients could be classified correctly. In the following two steps, the MVG
variables "Correct Recall TrialS" and URetroactive Interference" were included in the
model and the percentage of patients classified correctly increased to 1000/0 (see Table
4). Compared with patients with very mild
deluentia, OAT patients nl0re often had
disturbances of apperception, a greater susceptibility to "retroactive interference," and
fewer items remembered at Trial 5 of the
Gernlan version of the CVLT, indicating that
their verbal learning abilities were impaired
(see Tables 5 and 6).

Very Mild Dementia vs.

Neuropsychological variables correctly

When all available levels of assessnlent
were used sinlultaneouslYt five variables
were needed to correctly classify all cases.

(see Table 4). Compared with control subjects, patients with very mild dementia had
a higher frequency of complaints of difficulties of orientation; they produced luore errors at the CANTAB-DREP task with three
patterns; and they solved fewer sets in the
CANTAB-DREP task. Both variables are indicative of inlpairecl ViSllospatial conditional learning. They also reluenlbered
fewer positions correctly in the CANTABPOSITION task, indicating that they had

patients and control subjects being classified correctly increased to 100°1'0. Compared
with control subjects, patients with mild-to1110derate DAT remembered fewer items at
Trial 5 of the Gennan version of the CVLT,
indicating that these OAT patients showed
hnpaired verbal learning abilities. They also
produced more errors on the recognition
task of the MVG 27 (Table 6).
When all sets of variables were llsed
sinlultaneouslYt the results of the analysis
with neuropsychological variables (see
Table 4) were replicated.

DISCUSSION
Previously reported results using neuropsychological variables to lueasure the
distinction between patients with mild-tomoderate OAT and control subjects show
sinli1ar high rates of correct prediction of
diagnostic category.7-9,42,-13 Results differ with
regard to the variables that discrinlinate best
between groUpSt depending to S0111e extent
on the neuropsychological instruments
llsed. In clinical practice, the differentiation
of Inild-to-moderate OAT from noeolal aging
does not pose great problems. However,
individuals with very Inild dementia and
healthy control subjects often overlap considerably in cognitive performance. 2 At present these two groups cannot sufficiently be
distinguished using neuropsychological
variables alone. Our results indicate that the
discrimination of very mild detnentia from
nornlal aging t on the one side, and from
luild-ta-moderate OAT, on the other, was
improved when additional levels of assess111ent were included.
For the differentiation of patients with
very luild denlentia from control subjects,
the inclusion of subjective cOlnplaints of
orientation difficulties resulted in an improvement in the rate of correctly classified
participants frOITI 80.6% to 1000/0. Whereas
subjective memory conlplaints appear to be
strongly correlated with depressive symptomatology,44-46 subjective complaints of
39

Clinical Recognition qf VelY Milel Den1entia

orientation difficulties have not been studied extensively despite the finding that spatial orientation problelTIS may be an early
sign of DAT. 47
If psychopathological variables are included in the discrimination of patients with
mild-to-tTIoderate OAT and patients with
very mild dementia, the rate of correctly
predicted diagnostic category increased
fronl 94.3% to 1000/0. The existence of
disturbances of apperception was a good
predictor of mild-to-ITIoderate DAT. Disturbances of apperception could be regarded
as Uthe inability to grasp the ITIeaning and
significance of experience or to see the
ll1eaningful connections between thenl, in a

broader sense, the inability to integrate new
experiences with one's own past experience (p. 49).,,23 More research is needed to
investigate different aspects of disturbances
of apperception in the course of denlentia.
Further studies are required to evaluate
validity, reliability, and specificity of subjective orientation problel11s and disturbances
of apperception. Their usefulness in the
identification of very 111ild dementia has to
be evaluated in a different, larger, and diagnostically nl0re honl0geneous saluple of
patients with very 111ild denlentia.
One caveat in the interpretation of the
reported findings should be noted. Our results are based on exploratory data-analytic
