We examined whether patterns of sex differences on tasks of perceptual speed, episodic memory, verbal fluency,
and verbal knowledge are maintained during advanced old age. Using incomplete 13-year longitudinal data from
participants in the Berlin Aging Study screened for dementia (N = 368; M = 83 years; range 70–100 years at
baseline assessment), we estimated sex-specific age trajectories of cognitive change and explored the contributing
role of education and attrition. We found that women and men declined virtually in parallel, with no evidence
of differential change. After we controlled for age cohort-related differences in education, women outperformed
men on tasks in the four cognitive domains. Findings also provide initial evidence that sex differences might be
masked by differential patterns of sample attrition.

C

ROSS-SECTIONAL studies have documented that men
outperform women on tasks requiring visuospatial processing whereas women show an advantage on many episodic
memory tasks and a variety of speeded tasks, including Digit
Symbol Substitution, Finding As, and Picture Identiﬁcation
(e.g., Maitland, Herlitz, Nyberg, Backman, & Nilsson, 2004;
¨
Meinz & Salthouse, 1998). It is not clear whether these sex
differences change in pattern and magnitude during old age and
if they generalize to the oldest-old population (e.g., individuals
85 years of age or older; see Hassing, Wahlin, & Backman,
¨
1998). Some longitudinal studies report preserved sex differences and parallel patterns of decline (e.g., Finkel, Reynolds,
McArdle, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2003; Schaie, 2005). Others argue
that women are especially vulnerable to decline in memory
(e.g., Zelinski & Stewart, 1998).
Two sets of intertwined factors may inﬂuence samplespeciﬁc ﬁndings about sex differences in level and slope of
cognitive change in advanced old age. First, there are effects
attributable to gender- and cohort-linked inequalities in societal
opportunity structures, such as access to formal and professional education, that have consequences for the development of cognitive reserve capacity (e.g., Elias, Elias,
D’Agostino, Silbershatz, & Wolf, 1997; Seeman et al., 2005;
Smith & Baltes, 1998). Second, there are sex differences in
dementia incidence and longevity that may play a role in
sample attrition (e.g., Fratiglioni et al., 1997; Rabbitt, Lunn, &
Wong, 2005).
We applied multilevel modeling to estimate sex-speciﬁc age
trajectories in normal cognitive aging on eight tasks for a
subsample of incomplete 13-year longitudinal data from the
Berlin Aging Study (BASE; Baltes & Mayer, 1999). The present study thus extends previous cross-sectional analyses
(Lindenberger & Baltes, 1997) and 6-year longitudinal analyses
of sex differences in cognition in the BASE (see Singer,
Verhaeghen, Ghisletta, Lindenberger, & Baltes, 2003). Unlike
researchers in earlier BASE reports, we speciﬁcally exclude
participants with suspected dementia and examine education
and sex-speciﬁc attrition effects. We also evaluate sex differences at the level of individual cognitive tests rather than ability

composites, because the effects of sex may differ by test within
an ability and be masked by aggregating across tests.

METHODS

Participants and Procedure
We analyzed a subsample of BASE data from ﬁve measurement occasions collected over 13 years: Time 1 (T1; 1990–
1993), Time 3 (T3; 1995–1996), Time 4 (T4; 1997–1998),
Time 5 (T5; 2000), and Time 6 (T6; 2004–2005). (An additional assessment in 1993–1994 [Time 2] involved only one
session and could not be included here because it did not
provide comprehensive cognitive data.) Table 1 provides sample and descriptive information. T3 took place 3.76 years
after T1 (SD ¼ 0.76); T4, 5.48 years (SD ¼ 0.80); T5, 8.94 years
(SD ¼ 0.87); and T6, 12.99 years (SD ¼ 0.90) after T1,
respectively. Comprehensive information about the T1, T3, and
T4 samples and cognitive measures is published in Baltes
and Mayer (1999) and Lovden, Ghisletta, and Lindenberger
¨ ´
(2004). We excluded from our analyses those participants at
each occasion who were below an age cohort-speciﬁc cutoff on
a dementia screening instrument (Short Mini-Mental State
Examination, or SMMSE; Klein et al., 1985; 70–84 years,
,12 points; 85þ years, ,11 points). Independent clinical
diagnoses of dementia in the BASE at T1 and T3 indicated
sufﬁcient speciﬁcity (72–98%) and sensitivity of the exclusion
criteria (63–88%), both among the old-old and oldest-old
women and men. Overall, we excluded 82 women and 66 men
(see endnote 1). The average age of the total (incomplete)
sample (N ¼ 751) was 83.65 years (SD ¼ 7.20; born between
1887 and 1922). Although each participant idiographically
contributed different longitudinal time segments (observation
period, M ¼ 3.4 years; SD ¼ 4.6; range ¼ 0–15 years) to an age
gradient spanning 30 years, the age information entered into the
models was spread relatively equally across the three age
decades (70s, n ¼ 237; 80s, n ¼ 341; 90s, n ¼ 173).
Longitudinal sample attrition was primarily due to mortality:
At T6, 83% of the participants in the T1 baseline sample were

known to be deceased from registry information. We assessed
attrition effects on the cognitive tasks by using a method
described by Lindenberger, Singer, and Baltes (2002). Participants who contributed two measurements performed on average
0.29 SD units higher at T1 than did participants assessed only
once. Participants who subsequently contributed ﬁve occasions
performed 0.53 SD higher at T1. These effects were higher
for women than for men (e.g., T4: 0.47 SD vs 0.36 SD).
On average, longitudinal participants had a higher education
level (0.11 SD) and, as to be expected, they were younger at
T1 (0.69 SD).

Measures
Cognition. —We used eight tests to assess four intellectual
abilities: Digit Letter and Identical Pictures tests to assess
perceptual speed; Paired Associates and Memory for Text tests
to assess episodic memory; Categories and Word Beginnings
tests to assess ﬂuency; and Vocabulary and Spot a Word tests to
assess knowledge. At each occasion, testing was supported by
a Macintosh SE/30 computer equipped with a touch-sensitive
screen; the same test versions were administered in individual
sessions at the participant’s residence (see Lindenberger &

Baltes, 1997; Lovden et al., 2004). Missing data because of
¨ ´
poor vision amounted to 3% (205 of 6,008 data points).
Education. —Educational information was not available for
12 participants, but we estimated it with linear regression
analyses using equivalent income (see Baltes & Mayer, 1999).
On average, men had more education (11.7 years, SD ¼ 2.5,
T scores ¼ 53.7) than did women (10.4 years, SD ¼ 2.1,
T scores ¼ 48.5): F(1, 366) ¼ 27.38, p , .001.

RESULTS
We used the SAS procedure Proc Mixed (Littell, Miliken,
Stoup, & Wolﬁnger, 1996) to estimate individual growth
models from 70 to 100 years, separately for the eight cognitive
tests. We centered age at 85 years for the estimation of intercepts, slopes, and intercept–slope covariances. We used the
full-information maximum likelihood estimation algorithm,
employed an unstructured covariance matrix for the random
effects, and included all data available (5,803 observations, in
total). This accommodated for unbalanced data structures, that
is, individual differences in intervals between assessments,
and incomplete data under the missing-at-random assumption
(McArdle, 1994).

cognitive tests: Digit Letter, Paired Associates, Memory for Text, Word Beginnings, and Spot a Word. For example, women outperformed men on
the Paired Associates test by 4 T-score units. Although both show linear decline amounting to approximately 3 T-score units per decade, sex
differences remain constant during advanced old age. We standardized T scores to the T1 parent BASE sample (N ¼ 516), M ¼ 50, SD ¼ 10, to
ensure a common metric while maintaining both the psychometric properties of the scores and the longitudinal changes in means and variances.

In a ﬁrst step, we estimated the amount of between- and
within-person variance by considering models that allowed
random effects only for the intercept (i.e., no change allowed).
Most of the total variation was between-person variance (61%,
averaged across the tests), but each measure showed sizeable
within-person variation that was indicative of change over time
(e.g., Memory for Text test: 57%).
In a second step, we tested models including ﬁxed effects for
intercept, linear slopes, and quadratic slopes as well as random
effects for intercept, linear slope, and the intercept–linear slope
covariance (see endnote 2). Estimated ﬁxed effects for all
cognitive tests produced intercepts similar to the mean of the T1
sample (e.g., Digit Letter test: 49.93, SE ¼ 0.53). Over time, all
cognitive tests displayed negative linear age slopes (e.g., Digit
Letter test: À0.78 T-score decline per year), and we found
(marginally) signiﬁcant negative quadratic age trends for six
tests (the Digit Letter, Identical Pictures, Paired Associates,
Word Beginnings, Vocabulary, and Spot-a-Word tests), suggesting an acceleration of linear decline among the oldest-old
individuals. Descriptively, this component was strongest for the
Digit Letter test (À0.03). We found random effects for the
intercepts on all eight tests, whereas we found random effects
for the linear slope only for the Digit Letter and Categories
tests. The intercept–linear slope covariances were signiﬁcant
and positive for the Digit Letter, Identical Pictures, and Spota-Word tests.
To examine sources of variability, we entered education and
gender as covariates. Education was signiﬁcantly associated
with variance in intercept on all tests (e.g., 0.37 for the
Vocabulary test). Most importantly, once we took differences in
education into account, women outperformed men on ﬁve out
of eight tests: Digit Letter (2.19, p , .05), Paired Associates
(4.09, p , .001), Memory for Text (3.54, p , .001), Word
Beginnings (2.32, p , .05), and Spot-a-Word (2.22, p , .05).
These effect sizes were between 2 and 4 T-score units.
According to statistical convention (e.g., Cohen, 1988), the
effects range from small (Spot a Word test) to almost moderate
(Paired Associates test) in magnitude. None of the interactions
(Education 3 Linear slope, Sex 3 Linear slope, and Education 3 Sex 3 Linear slope) was signiﬁcantly different from zero,
indicating preserved sex- and education-related differences
during advanced old age (see endnote 3). Interestingly, analyses
not adjusting for education indicated fewer advantages for
women (Paired Associates test: 3.00, p , .01; Memory for Text
test: 2.89; p , .01), as well as an advantage for men on the
Vocabulary test (À2.89; p , .01). Figure 1 separately illustrates
cognitive age trajectories for women and men after we
residualized performance scores for education.

DISCUSSION
Our goal was to extend longitudinal evidence on patterns of
sex differences in cognitive aging during advanced old age.
Using 13-year longitudinal data from 70- to 100-year-old
participants in the BASE who were screened for dementia, we
found that, after we controlled for gender- and cohort-related
differences in education, women outperformed men on tests
across the four cognitive domains examined. Over time, all
cognitive tests showed linear (or even quadratic) decline over
the 30-year period of old age modeled. Women and men

showed parallel trajectories of cognitive aging, which suggests
that neither sex nor education is associated with differential
cognitive decline (see endnote 4).
As is well established in the cognitive aging literature,
sample attrition was selective in that the more data participants
provided for longitudinal change estimates, the better was
their cognitive performance at T1. We acknowledge that the
capability of likelihood analyses under the missing-at-random
assumption to accommodate incomplete data (e.g., including
attrition-informative variables such as age) is restricted if unobserved change considerably differs from observed change;
we also acknowledge that our results are contingent on
common, but untested, statistical assumptions (e.g., ergodicity;
see Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heerden, 2003). Indeed,
our ﬁndings likely underestimate true cognitive change and
associated interindividual differences. Future research should
speciﬁcally explore whether sex-differential selection effects at
the population level (e.g., survival, dementia) and at the sample
level (e.g., attrition) nullify, create, or diminish differences
between women and men (Smith & Baltes, 1998).
Life course theories suggest and evidence has shown that the
negative consequences of fewer lifetime educational and
occupational opportunities have followed current cohorts of
old women into advanced old age. In line with this, our analyses suggest that men’s overall higher level of education
suppresses women’s advantage on tasks assessing perceptual
speed, episodic memory, ﬂuency, and knowledge. Thus, independent of the biological underpinning, sociocultural factors
appear to shape the magnitude of sex differences in cognitive
functioning over the entire life span.
We found that, both when we did adjust and when we did not
adjust for differences in early-life education, sex differences in
cognition were stable into the highest ages with no evidence of
change in magnitude. This sex-equivalent longitudinal decline
is in line with recent evidence of parallel cortical brain atrophy
in women and men (Raz et al., 2005). Although some research
from major large-scale longitudinal studies have documented
more rapid decline for women than for men (e.g., Zelinski &
Stewart, 1998), several studies report sex differences in level,
but not in subsequent, change (e.g., Finkel et al., 2003). Our
ﬁndings add to this. It seems that the major biological and
psychological changes associated with aging do not modify or
affect sex differences in cognition. Given the extant interest in
the heterogeneity of cognitive aging, a more promising approach for future studies may involve examining how macrostructural indices such as gender and education are involved in
bringing about diverse within-domain and across-domain
proﬁles of functioning in advanced old age (e.g., Smith &
Baltes, 1998).

END NOTES
1. Although we did not exclude signiﬁcantly more women than
men, v2(1, N ¼ 516) ¼ 2.43, p . .10, sex differences among
those excluded were found in age—men, 87.9 years; women,
90.6 years; F(1, 146) ¼ 4.19, p , .05—and SMMSE—men, M ¼
8.6; women, M ¼ 7.4; F(1, 146) ¼ 9.77, p , .01. Women and
men included in the study did not differ in age, T1, F(1, 366) ¼
1.62, p . .10, and SMMSE, T1, F(1, 366) ¼ 0.21, p . .10.
2. We residualized the quadratic terms for linear terms of age (as
obtained in regression analyses; cf. Lovden et al., 2004) to arrive
¨ ´
at a quadratic component that is independent of the linear
component. Follow-up analyses of these quadratic terms
revealed that none of the eight cognitive tests displayed
statistically signiﬁcant individual differences in the quadratic
age trends, thereby precluding the possibility to test for sex
differences in quadratic age trends.
3. In follow-up analyses, we additionally included ﬂat or linear
retest effects in our models. Analogous to the ﬁndings of
Lovden and colleagues (2004), we found evidence for either or
¨ ´
both types of retest effects on some of the tests (e.g., Memory
for Text). However, the reported pattern of cognitive sex
differences remained virtually the same. We also modeled
cognitive change over time in study (see also Sliwinski &
Buschke, 2004) and used chronological age, education, and sex
as covariates. Results of these analyses again were consistent
with the pattern reported.
4. Although our data basis would have, in principle, made it
possible to consider higher order relations above quadratic
functions, attrition substantially reduced our sample of
participants contributing 3 or more data points, thereby making
it difﬁcult to reliably test for other than linear and quadratic age
functions. Furthermore, we found individual differences only in
the linear component of age-related change, which precluded
us from being able to test for sex differences in other than the
linear component.
