Abstract
We investigated the effects of age and (9 )-methyl-3-ethyl-2,3,3a,4-tetrahydro-1H-indolo[3,2,1-de] [1,5] naphthyridine-6-carboxylate hydrochloride (vinconate), an indolonaphthyridine derivative, on calcium channels, neurotransmitter receptor systems and
immunophilin in Fischer rat brain using quantitative receptor autoradiography. [3H]MK801, [3H]glycine, sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate, [3H]FK-506 and [3H]PN200-110 were
used to label N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, glycine receptors, excitatory amino
acid transport sites, FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP) and voltage-dependent L-type calcium
channels, respectively. [3H]Glycine and sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding signiﬁcantly decreased in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens,
hippocampus, thalamus, substantia nigra and cerebellum of 24 month old rats in comparison
with 6 month old animals. In contrast, [3H]MK-801, [3H]FK-506 and [3H]PN200-110 binding
showed no signiﬁcant change in the brain of 24 month old rats. Intraperitoneal chronic
treatment with vinconate (10 and 30 mg/kg, once a day for 4 weeks) dose-dependently
ameliorated the signiﬁcant reduction in [3H]glycine and sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate

binding in the brain of 24 month old rats. These results demonstrate that glycine receptors
and excitatory amino acid transport sites are more susceptible to aging processes than
NMDA receptors, immunophilin and voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. Furthermore, our ﬁndings suggest that vinconate may have a beneﬁcial effect on age-related changes
in glycine receptors and excitatory amino acid transport sites. © 1997 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
A number of clinical and experimental studies of neurotransmitter receptor
systems in various brain areas have been reported. Recent evidence has demonstrated that advanced age was associated with major changes in cognitive and
functional impairments in the central nervous system (CNS). The relationship between the deterioration of neurotransmitter system and impairment of
cognitive functions such as learning and memory is also suggested by several
experimental studies [1,2]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the age-related decline of cognitive function is closely linked to impairments of neurotransmitter
systems.
It is recognized that glutamate and glycine are the major neurotransmitters in
the mammalian CNS [3,4]. The glycine has recently been shown to enhance the
excitatory action of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), glutamate and other agonists at NMDA receptors [5,6]. The cloning of functional NMDA receptors has
demonstrated that both glutamate- and glycine-recognition sites reside on the
same protein [7]. Receptor autoradiography with [3H]glycine also revealed that
the regional distribution of the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor was very
similar to that of the NMDA receptors [8,9]. These observations seem to indicate that glycine plays an important role in regulating the activity of the NMDA
receptors which are considered to play some role in age-related neurogenerative
disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases [10–13].
On the other hand, the action of endogenous excitatory amino acids such as
glutamate and aspartate within a synapse is terminated by speciﬁc and high
afﬁnity transport into presynaptic terminals or glia [14–16]. The ability of the
excitatory transport system to maintain extracellular levels of excitatory amino
acids is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the damage to
various brain regions [17,18]. Sodium-dependent excitatory transport is thought
to account for the majority of the transport of excitatory amino acids at glutamatergic and aspartatergic synapses [19–21]. Therefore, the effect of aging on
sodium-dependent transport systems is of interest to the speciﬁcity of age-related
neurological and cognitive deﬁcits.

Calcium is implicated in numerous function and plays a central role as an
intracellular messenger. The voltage-dependent calcium channels are the main
pathways of entrance of calcium from an extracellular space. The brain is highly
dependent upon several regulated processes for the maintenaces of its homeostasis.
Therefore, abnormal intracellular calcium homeostasis has been proposed to be
involved in neuronal dysfunction in aging processes [22,23] and in conditions such
as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease [24,25].
Interestingly, a recent study suggested that immunosuppressant FK-506 can
protect against the neuronal damage after focal ischemia in rats [26] and inhibit
MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced dopamine depletion
in the striatum of mice [27]. Dawson et al. [28] also reported that FK-506 can
inhibit neurotoxicity of NMDA in primary cortical cultures by enhancing the
phosphorylation of nitric oxide (NOS). From these ﬁndings, it is conceivable that
FK-506 may play a role in regulating age-related neurological deﬁcits such as
stroke and Parkinson’s disease.
Vinconate is an indolonaphthyridine derivative and is known to signiﬁcantly
prolong the duration of consciousness and delayed the appearance of electroencephalographic disturbances under hypoxic conditions [29]. This drug is also known
to improve psychomotor activity, cognitive function, attention and concentration in
elderly subjects [30]. In experimental animals, the beneﬁcial effects of vinconate
have been conﬁrmed by behavioral studies using amnesia models induced by basal
forebrain and medial septal lesions [31,32]. Furthermore, we previously reported
that vinconate can prevent ischemic brain damage in experimental animals [33,34].
These observations seem to suggest that vinconate may be effective for the
treatment of age-related neurological disorders such as stroke and neuropsychiatric
symptoms associated with senile dementia.
In the present study, therefore, we focused upon NMDA, glycine, glutamate
transport system, immunosuppressant and voltage-dependent calcium channels, and
analyzed regional age-related changes of these binding sites in the rat brain.
Furthermore, we examined the effects of chronic treatment with vinconate against
age-related alterations of these binding sites in the rat brains which are considered
to be impaired in cognitive function and psychomotor performance, using receptor
autoradiography.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Experimental animals
Male Fischer 344 rats, 6 months and 24 months of age, were used in this study.
Animals were killed by decapitation under a light ether. The brains were removed
quickly, frozen in powdered dry ice, and stored at − 80°C until assay. Sagittal
sections 12 vm in thickness were cut on a cryostat and thaw-mounted onto
gelatin-coated slides. Adjacent brain sections were stained with cresyl violet.
Animals were divided into four groups: (1) 6 month old group; (2) 24 month old

16

group; (3) 10 mg/kg vinconate-treated group (Tokyo Tanabe, Japan); and (4) 30
mg/kg vinconate-treated group. The rats in groups (2)–(4) were 24 months old.
Vinconate or vehicle (distilled water) was administered i.p. once a day for 4 weeks
before decapitation in each group. Each group contained 6–7 animals. In addition,
there were no signiﬁcant differences among the three 24 month old rat groups
(2) – (4) in body weight.

2.2. Receptor autoradiography
2.2.1. [ 3H]MK-801 binding
Autoradiographic distribution of MK-801 binding sites was determined according to the method of Bowery et al. [35] with minor modiﬁcations [36]. Brain
sections were rinsed in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 190 mM
sucrose and dried under a cold air stream. The sections were then incubated with
30 nM [3H]MK-801 (New England Nuclear, speciﬁc activity 20.3 Ci/mmol) in the
buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Then the sections were washed in fresh
buffer twice for 20 s at room temperature. Non-speciﬁc binding was determined
with 100 vM unlabeled MK-801 (Research Biochemicals).
2.2.2. [ 3H]Glycine binding
Autoradiographic localization of glycine binding sites was determined according
to the method of Miyoshi et al. [7] with minor modiﬁcations [37]. Brain sections
were preincubated with 0.04% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 2°C to allow dissociation
of endogenous inhibitors. After washing, the sections were incubated with 80 nM
[3H]glycine (New England Nuclear, speciﬁc activity 38.8 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM
Tris – acetate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min at 2°C. Then the sections were washed
three times in ice-cold fresh buffer for 10 s. Non-speciﬁc binding was determined
using 1 vM unlabeled glycine (Sigma).
2.2.3. Sodium-dependent D -[ 3H]aspartate (excitatory amino acid transport system)
binding
Autoradiographic distribution of sodium-dependent D-aspartate binding sites was
determined using the method of Anderson et al. [38,39] with minor modiﬁcations.
Brain sections were preincubated for 10 min at 30°C in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 7.4). The sections were then incubated with 100 nM D-[3H]aspartate (New
England Nuclear, speciﬁc activity 12.8 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH
7.4) including 300 mM NaCl for 10 min at 2°C. After incubation, the sections were
washed four times in fresh ice-cold buffer for a total of 30 s. Non-speciﬁc binding
was determined with 100 vM D,L-threo-i-hydroxyaspartate (Sigma).
2.2.4. [ 3H]FK-506 (Immunosuppressant) binding
Autoradiographic localization of FK-506 binding sites was detected according to
the method of Steiner et al. [40] with minor modiﬁcations. Brain sections were
preincubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)
including 2 mg/ml BSA and 0.02% Tween-20. The sections were then incubated

17

with 1 nM [3H]FK-506 (New England Nuclear, speciﬁc activity 95.4 Ci/mmol) in 50
mM HEPES containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 0.02% Tween-20 for 60 min at room
temperature. After incubation, the sections were washed four times for 5 min in
fresh ice-cold buffer. Non-speciﬁc binding was determined using 1 vm unlabeled
FK-506 (Fujisawa).

2.2.5. [ 3H]PN200 -110 (Voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker) binding
Autoradiographic distribution of PN200-110 binding sites was determined according to the method of Cortes et al. [41] with minor modiﬁcations [42]. Brain
sections were incubated with 0.1 nM [3H]PN200-110 (New England Nuclear,
speciﬁc activity 71.5 Ci/mmol) in 170 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 60 min at
room temperature. The sections were then washed in fresh ice-cold buffer for 20
min. Non-speciﬁc binding was determined using 1 vM unlabeled nitrendipine
(Sigma).
2.3. Data analysis
The above brain sections were rapidly dried under a cold air stream and were
exposed to Hyperﬁlm-3H (Amersham) for 3–4 weeks in X-ray cassettes with a set
of [3H]microscales (Amersham). The optical density of the brain areas was measured with a computer-assisted image analyzer, as described previously [37,43,44].
The relationship between the optical density and radioactivity was obtained with
reference to the 3H-microscales co-exposed with the brain sections. Values were
expressed as the means 9S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.

3. Results
Representative autoradiograms of [3H]MK-801, [3H]glycine, sodium-dependent
D-[3H]aspartate, [3H]FK-506 and [3H]PN200-110 binding are shown in Figs. 1 and
2. Effects of vinconate on regional age-related changes of [3H]MK-801, [3H]glycine,
sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate, [3H]FK-506 and [3H]PN200-110 binding are
summarized in Tables 1 – 5.

3.1. [ 3H]MK-801 binding
In 6 month old rats, [3H]MK-801 binding was greatest in the hippocampal CA1
sector and dentate gyrus. The frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, nucleus
accumbens, hippocampal CA3 sector and thalamus also had a relatively high
density of [3H]MK-801 binding. The substantia nigra and cerebellum showed a low
density of [3H]MK-801 binding. In 24 month old rats, no signiﬁcant alteration in
[3H]MK-801 binding was observed in all brain regions as compared with 6 month
old animals, although all regions showed the tendency of decrease of the binding.
Chronic treatment with vinconate at a dose 10 or 30 mg/kg also showed no

signiﬁcant change in [3H]MK-801 binding in the brain of 24 month old rats
(Table 1).

3.2. [ 3H]Glycine binding
In 6 month old rats, the highest [3H]glycine binding was evident in the hippocampal CA1 sector and dentate gyrus. The frontal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum,
nucleus accumbens, hippocampal CA3 sector and thalamus had a relatively high
density of [3H]glycine binding. The substantia nigra and cerebellum showed a
relatively low density of [3H]glycine binding. In 24 month old rats, a signiﬁcant
decrease in [3H]glycine binding was observed in all brain regions as compared with
6 month old animals. In contrast, chronic treatment with vinconate at a dose of 10
mg/kg ameliorated a conspicuous reduction in [3H]glycine binding in the hippocampal CA1 sector and dentate gyrus of 24 month old rats. Chronic vinconate
treatment at the higher dose also ameliorated a signiﬁcant reduction in [3H]glycine
binding in all brain regions of 24 month old rats (Table 2).

In 6 month old rats, sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding was greatest in
the hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus and molecular layer of cerebellum. The
substantia nigra had a low density of sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding.
Other regions showed a relatively high density of sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate
binding. In 24 month old rats, a conspicuous reduction in sodium-dependent
D-[3H]aspartate binding was observed in all brain areas as compared with 6 month
old animals. Chronic treatment with vinconate at a dose of 10 mg/kg ameliorated
a signiﬁcant reduction in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding in the frontal
cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, hippocampal CA1 sector,
dentate gyrus and cerebellum of 24 month old rats. Chronic vinconate treatment at
the higher dose signiﬁcantly ameliorated a conspicuous reduction in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding in all brain areas of 24 month old rats (Table 3).

3.4. [ 3H]FK-506 binding
In 6 month old rats, the highest [3H]FK-506 binding was evident in the
hippocampus, especially the hippocampal CA1 sector. The striatum and nucleus
accumbens had a relatively high density of [3H]FK-506 binding. [3H]FK-506
binding was also evident in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, substantia
nigra and molecular layer of cerebellum. The granule cell layer of cerebellum had
a low density of [3H]FK-506 binding. In 24 month old rats, no signiﬁcant change
in [3H]FK-506 binding was observed in all brain areas. Chronic treatment with
vinconate at a dose of 10 or 30 mg/kg also showed no signiﬁcant alteration in
[3H]FK-506 binding in most brain areas of 24 month old rats. Chronic vinconate
treatment at the higher dose showed a signiﬁcant increase in [3H]FK-506 binding
only in the frontal cortex of 24 month old rats (Table 4).

3.5. [ 3H]PN200 -110 binding
In 6 month old, [3H]PN200-110 binding was greatest in the dentate gyrus. The
frontal cortex, parietal cortex and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors had a
relatively high density of [3H]PN200-110 binding. The striatum, nucleus accumbens
and thalamus showed a mediate density of [3H]PN200-110 binding. However, the
substantia nigra and cerebellum showed a low density of [3H]PN200-110 binding. In
24 month old rats, no signiﬁcant change was observed in all brain areas as
compared with 6 month old animals. Chronic treatment with vinconate at a dose of

10 or 30 mg/kg also showed no signiﬁcant change in [3H]PN200-110 binding in all
brain regions of 24 month old rats (Table 5).

4. Discussion
The present study demonstrated that age-related reductions in [3H]glycine and
sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding were found among various brain regions, whereas [3H]PN200-110, [3H]MK-801 and [3H]FK-506 binding showed no
signiﬁcant change in rat brains. Furthermore, our study suggested that a novel
indolonaphthyridine derivative, vinconate, signiﬁcantly ameliorated the age-related
reductions in [3H]glycine and sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding in most
brain areas in a dose-dependent manner.
NMDA receptors are considered to play a critical role in many neurophysiological processes that underlie cognitive function [45–47]. It is also known that the
dysfunction of NMDA receptors is associated with learning and memory deﬁcits
[48]. Recent studies suggest that age-related changes in NMDA receptors or
glutamatergic system may relate to the impairments of cognitive function with
aging [49 – 51]. These observations are of interest with regard to the speciﬁcity of
any age-related deﬁcits of NMDA receptors as well as cognitive function.

Several authors have reported the presence of a receptor for the amino acid
glycine in mammalian brain [8,52].The glycine receptor is known to be closely
linked to the NMDA receptors, as glycine can potently enhance the actions of the
NMDA and glutamate but no kainate or quisqualate in an electrophysiological
study [6]. Autoradiographic studies have also demonstrated an association between
glycine and NMDA receptors, based on the close similarity in anatomical distributions [8,9,52,53]. These observations suggest that glycine is involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission through NMDA receptor-associated glycine binding sites.
Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated a severe decline in glycine receptors in
aged rat brains. Therefore, glycine receptors as well as NMDA receptors may play
a signiﬁcant role in aging processes.
In the present study, no signiﬁcant change in [3H]MK-801 binding was found in
brain of 24 month old rats, as compared with 6 month old animals. Furthermore,
chronic treatment with vinconate showed no signiﬁcant alteration in [3H]MK-801
binding in 24 month old rat brains. In contrast, an age-related reduction in
[3H]glycine binding was observed in various brain regions. Chronic treatment with
vinconate dose-dependently ameliorated the reduction in [3H]glycine binding in 24
month old rat brains. These ﬁndings are, at least in part, consistent with the
previous reports of Miyoshi et al. [7] who demonstrated a conspicuous decrease in
[3H]glycine binding to various brain regions in aged rats. In contrast, our results
with [3H]MK-801 binding was out of accord with the previous ﬁnding [54]. The

precise reason for this difference is difﬁcult to explain by the present study.
However, several authors suggested that [3H]glutamate binding was increased in the
brain of aged rats and monkey [55,56]. Thus evidence for age-related changes in
glutamate receptors is contradictory. Although the detailed reason for our ﬁndings
is presently unclear, the present study demonstrates that the NMDA receptor itself
doses not change, whereas the glycine receptor is affected in the brain during aging.
On the other hand, vinconate is reported to attenuate ischemia-induced release of
glutamate and aspartate in the rat hippocampus [57]. Furthermore, this drug is
known to have no effect on the binding of [3H]MK-801 in the rat brain [58]. From
these observations and our present results, we speculate that vinconate may
ameliorate the age-related decrease in [3H]glycine binding via regulation of NMDAassociated glycine binding sites.
The presence in the brain of a speciﬁc uptake system for glutamate and aspartate
is the most important mechanism for regulating the synaptic activity of these
excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters. The glutamate is rapidly removed from
the synaptic cleft by reuptake into glutamatergic nerve terminals and glia cells [14].
In particular, sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transport system plays a
major role in the clearance of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and
aspartate. However, the dysfunction of the transport system may contribute to
extracellular overﬂow of these amino acids. Therefore, excitotoxic neuronal damage
caused by massive levels of excitatory amino acids is thought to be a contributing
factor in the neuronal cell loss associated with neurological disorders such as

epilepsy, ischemia, hypoglycemia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease
[18,19,59 – 61]. The present study showed that a signiﬁcant decrease in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate binding was found in all brain areas of 24 month old rats,
as compared with 6 month old rats. Chronic treatment with vinconate dose-dependently ameliorated the signiﬁcant reduction in sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate
binding in the brain of 24 month old rats. These results demonstrate that sodiumdependent D-[3H]aspartate binding is susceptible to aging processes. Furthermore,
our ﬁndings suggest that vinconate can attenuate a signiﬁcant decrease in sodiumdependent D-[3H]aspartate binding in the brain of 24 month old rats. However,
further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanism for our ﬁndings.
The immunophilins are known to be highly concentrated in the brain in discrete
neuronal structures where they are co-localized with the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin [40]. A previous study demonstrated that immunosuppressant
drugs, FK-506 and cyclosporin A, can inhibit calcineurin activity [62]. Steiner et al.
[40] also reported that FK-506 and cyclosporin A can enhance the phosphorylation
of endogenous protein substrates in the rat brain tissue and in cultured PC 12 cells,
indicating that these drugs may inhibit phosphatase activity by interacting with the
immunophilin – calcineurin complexes. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that
FK-506 can enhance the phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and
protect against glutamate neurotoxicity in cell cultures [28]. This ﬁnding seems to
suggest that FK-506 bound to FKBP inhibits calcineurin activity, thereby increasing NOS phosphorylation and diminishing the NOS catalytic activity. Therefore,
FKBP may play a role in regulating glutamate neurotoxicity or glutamatergic
neurotransmission in the brain. However, the change of FKBP on aging processes

is presently unclear, although the localization is predominantly evident in the brain.
The present study showed that [3H]FK-506 binding revealed no signiﬁcant change
in the brain of 24 month old rats. Furthermore, chronic treatment with vinconate
showed a mild elevation in [3H]FK-506 binding only in the frontal cortex of 24
month old rats. However, other regions showed no signiﬁcant change in [3H]FK506 binding in vinconate-treated 24 month old rats. These ﬁndings seem to suggest
that immunophilin is resistant to aging processes. However, Steiner et al. [40] have
demonstrated the comparable levels of [3H]FK-506 binding in membrane and
soluble fractions in the brain. Furthermore, they suggest that the properties of
[3H]FK-506 binding are closely similar in membrane and soluble fractions in all
brain regions and peripheral tissues. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the
regional pattern of each soluble fraction for the further understanding of age-related changes in [3H]FK-506 binding in the brain.
Calcium ions play critical roles in various neuronal functions and altered calcium
homeostasis is known to be an important contributing factor in the expression of a
number of neuronal functions altered during aging, such as neurotransmitter
release, enzymatic functions and transport systems [63]. The brain is particularly
rich in high-afﬁnity voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel binding sites associated with neuronal elements [64]. Previous studies suggest that calcium-dependent
acetylcholine release is decreased in the brain aged mice [65] and perturbations in
normal calcium metabolism are correlated to cognitive function in aged rabbits [66].
Furthermore, several authors have reported that brain aging is accompanied by a
reduction in calcium uptake [67,68]. Therefore, an alteration in the ability of
neurons to allow calcium entry may be responsible for the decline in neurotransmitter release observed in various brain regions during aging [69]. In the present study,
however, no signiﬁcant change in [3H]PN200-110 binding was found in the brain of
24 month old rats, as compared with 6 month old animals. Furthermore, chronic
treatment with vinconate showed no signiﬁcant alteration in [3H]PN200-110 binding in 24 month old rat brains. A recent interesting study suggests that neuronal
losses known to occur in age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases are apparently not accompanied with parallel decrements in [3H]PN200-110 and [3H]D-888 binding to L-type calcium channels
[70]. This ﬁnding is in accord with our present results. In the brain, however, the
existence of at least four, L, N, P, T different sub-types of calcium channels has
been demonstrated [71 – 73]. It is also suggested that each sub-type mediates speciﬁc
neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter release, tropism and cytotoxicity
[71,73 – 76]. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the regional pattern of each
sub-type of calcium channels for the further understanding of age-related changes
in the brain using receptor autoradiographic and biochemical techniques.
In conclusion, the present study showed that [3H]glycine and sodium-dependent
D-[3H]aspartate binding signiﬁcantly decreased in 24 month old rat brains and that
chronic treatment with vinconate ameliorated these reductions. In contrast, no
age-related change was observed in [3H]PN200-110, [3H]MK-801 and [3H]FK-506
binding. These results suggest that vinconate may be a candidate for a drug for
age-related neurological disorders.
