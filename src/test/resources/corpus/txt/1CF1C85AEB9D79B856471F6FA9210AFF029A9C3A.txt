Developing an Interdisciplinary Innovative
Master of Gerontology Program
Ariela Lowenstein, PhD1
Purpose: This study describes the goals, development,
and outcomes of an innovative, interdisciplinary, Master
of Gerontology department, one of two programs in Israel
developed to answer Israel’s needs for highly educated
researchers and practitioners. Design: Key program
components reﬂecting the program’s innovative nature
are described: (a) level of development and promotion of
knowledge; (b) goals; (c) inﬂuence; and (d) patronage. Results: An interdisciplinary faculty and student
body both report a high satisfaction level, involvement,
and the obtainment of wide knowledge bases in
gerontology and geriatrics. The number of candidates
for the program increases each year. A new unique
program for physicians has evolved, with strong support
from the University of Haifa, the Council for Higher
Education in Israel, and key service organizations for the
elderly population. Implications: Such a program enhances the level of professional leadership in the ﬁeld of
aging, and it expands the cadre of academic faculty.

Key Words: Interdisciplinary education, Innovative
Master’s degree program, Promotion of
gerontological knowledge

The initiation and development of the Department of
Masters in Gerontology was in response to the
challenges facing the Israeli society regarding the rapid
aging of the population, and an accelerated growth of

welfare and health services for the aged. There was also
a growing body of research in gerontology and
geriatrics and a lack of speciﬁc and focused teaching
and training frameworks, mainly at the master’s level.
The development of the service network, especially
during the past decade, caused a shortage of human
capital trained in gerontology, both in academia and
research and in top administrative and care roles. Thus,
there was a need for high-quality graduate education.
Five years ago, to meet these challenges, researchers
started two new distinctive master’s programs—one at
the University of Haifa in the north as a special
department, and one at Ben-Gurion University in the
south as a graduate program. Both programs aimed at
attracting students from all academic disciplines and
professions that involved working with the elderly
population. The establishment of these programs
constitutes another milestone on the road toward
gerontology’s becoming a distinct discipline in Israel
(Lowenstein, 2001, 2004). Their creation was based on
the integration of two historic trends in the development
of gerontological knowledge: the growing academic
research base, and the professional application of
academic knowledge. In this article I focus on the
department at the University of Haifa. First, though, I
present some basic facts about the service network and
aging in Israel.

Aging in Israel
Israel is a pluralistic, democratic society. It is also an
urbanized welfare state that relies on a mixture of
governmental and market forces that shape its welfare
policies. The aging of the Israeli society is related to
increased life expectancy, which is currently 80.6 years
for women and 76.6 years for men, who, in this regard,
are ranked third in the world (WHO, 2001), and to the

composition and aging of cohorts from previous
immigration waves. The number of elderly persons
who are 65 years of age or older reached 653,000 in
2003. Their proportion in the Jewish population is 11%;
it is 3% in the non-Jewish sector, because of the higher
fertility rates of this sector. The number of ‘‘old-old,’’
that is, individuals 75 years of age or older, has grown
signiﬁcantly, increasing almost 10-fold between 1955
and 1998, from 26,000 to 252,000 (Brodsky, Shnoor &
Be’er, 2003; Central Bureau of Statistics, 2003).
Israel is a living laboratory that has absorbed
immigrants from more than 100 countries (Bergman
& Lowenstein, 1988), and the recent wave of immigrants during the 1990s brought a large percentage of
elderly persons (Carmel, 2002).
A country’s social system and professional practice
are affected by the particular society in which they
operate, and they reﬂect related historical, religious, and
cultural forces. Political structure and population
heterogeneity also shape service delivery. The longterm-care system in Israel is based on three main
principles and values. The ﬁrst of these concern Jewish
values, religious laws, traditions, and ethics that
emphasize social and familial responsibility (Lowenstein, 1998). The second is the principle of unlimited
immigration for all Jews, which is no doubt a central
determinant of Israel’s existence. The third is the
principle of cultural and ethnic pluralism that creates
a diversity of cultural, ethnic, and religious groups
(Lowenstein & Bergman, 1988). For example, only
10.6% of Israeli elders were born in Israel.
In order to address the special needs of various aging
population groups such as Jews and Arabs, veterans
and new immigrants, those who are religious and those
who are secular, holocaust survivors, and others, there
has been a rapid growth of social security, new welfare
legislation, health beneﬁts, and community services.
For the future, we can anticipate that changes in the
composition of the aged will result in continuing growth
of the ‘‘high-risk’’ groups: those over the age of 75,
women, those of Eastern origin, the disabled Arab
populations, and the aging holocaust survivors. These
projections mean that needs for long-term-care services
will increase and more resources will have to be allocated. This in turn means there will be a need for
expertly trained professionals and leaders in gerontology. Thus, in the new millennium, Israel faces the
dual challenge of meeting current needs while keeping
pace with anticipated needs (Lowenstein, 2000).

The Rationale for Creating the Master’s
Department
Given the scope of service delivery, where thousands
of social and health care professionals and semiprofessionals are employed, many of them without any
knowledge base or training in gerontology and geriatrics, the time was ripe to develop innovative academic
programs and to upgrade their level and prestige. Up to
4 years ago, though, the teaching of gerontology in
institutions of higher education was, at best, included as
a track or a number of courses in programs as social
256

work or nursing; it was not established as a unique
program by itself, as it is in other developed countries.
Evidence suggests that, in an attempt to deal with the
challenge of societal aging, educational institutions can
play a major role, facilitating the necessary social
change (Hyman, 1979). Developing educational programs in gerontology is one of the means of sensitizing
the public and professionals to the impact of an aging
society (Peterson, 1986). Therefore, the rationale for
creating the master’s program in gerontology was based
on the following three interrelated factors.
The ﬁrst factor was Need. The demographic revolution in modern Western society, with its increase in the
elderly population and the complexity of aging issues,
necessitates raising public and professional awareness
of the needs of older adults by creating speciﬁc knowledge bases.
The second factor was Need Recognition. Social
policy in developed countries recognized the importance
of providing quality care to the growing aged population, as manifested by the accelerated development of
long-term-care systems. The designation by the United
Nations of the year 1999 as the International Year of the
Older Persons, and the Madrid International Plan of
Action on Aging, 2002, were expressions of signiﬁcant
recognition.
The third factor was Acting on the Need. Gerontological knowledge and research databases have proliferated over the past few decades. This is reﬂected in
the wide array of evolving educational and training
programs, especially in the United States, in response to
the need to train researchers, educators, and professionals. However, acting on the need has a different
pace in different countries. The development in some
European countries has been slower than in others—
whereas in the United Kingdom currently 23 gerontological programs are operating, in Finland, Italy, and
Austria, only 1 such program was found (Meyer, 2003).
In Israel, acting on the need has become imperative in
view of the survey results on continuing educational
programs in aging that showed large gaps in knowledge
and skills within the care giving professions (Korazim,
Bareket, & Bergman, 1997).
The past decade in particular witnessed a surge in the
creation of gerontological studies with multidisciplinary
emphases. Nevertheless, the area remains problematic,
as aptly expressed by Robert Kastenbaum: ‘‘Gerontology remains a kind of shadow land today, despite all the
studies, courses, conferences, publications, and service
programs. . . . Gerontology is still highly dependent on
the whims of the academic/governmental complex’’
(1992, p. 135). The relatively new master’s program in
gerontology aims to cope with this shortcoming and
has developed with an emphasis on interdisciplinarity.
This article presents this 4-year experience.
The program was initiated and formulated to achieve
three goals. The ﬁrst goal was to establish a truly
interdisciplinary research-oriented Master of Gerontology degree. The goal is to enhance the scientiﬁc study of
aging and develop new knowledge bases unique to the
needs of Israeli society by educating a new cadre of
academic and practice-oriented leadership. In order to
The Gerontologist

achieve interdisciplinarity, the program draws on and
collaborates with other scholars from departments and
faculties at the university such as the Department of
Economics, the Faculties of Law and Business Administration, and the Faculty of Medicine at the Technion –
Israel Institute of Technology. It is activated in the
Faculty of Welfare and Health Studies, where it works
with all its departments and schools, such as the School
of Social Work and the School of Public Health or the
Departments of Nursing and Occupational Therapy.
The faculty members and the student body both reﬂect
the interdisciplinarity of the program. Department
members include a lawyer, a psychobiologist, and an
environmental planner, in addition to social and
behavioral science faculty and geriatricians. The student
body includes students such as a pharmacist, an
architect, and a lawyer.
The second goal was to upgrade the level of the
different professionals, planners, and administrators
working in the health and social services for the aged
in Israel. It is implemented by providing academic
expertise and training clinical practitioners in research
techniques, paying special attention to the unique
groups with whom they work, like holocaust survivors.
The goal is achieved by close collaboration with the
main service providers—the relevant Ministries of
Health and Welfare and ESHEL (The Association for
Planning and Development of Services for the Aged in
Israel). The strategy is to sensitize the professionals to
the special needs of diversiﬁed elderly populations and
develop meaningful practice-based interventions on the
microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel. The new knowledge of these individuals helps in the development and
evaluation of the effectiveness and efﬁciency of interventions.
The third goal was to achieve closer and more harmonious integration between research and practice.
This is accomplished by collaborating with the Center
for Research and Study of Aging (I am the head of the
Department of Gerontology and also the head of the
Research Center) and working closely with local and
national service organizations. This is also accomplished by involving a network of some of the most
prestigious international scholars in gerontology, such
as Professors Vern Bengtson and Merril Silverstein
from the University of Southern California and Professor Toni Antonucci from the University of Michigan,
in the research programs of the faculty and students.

General Program Overview
The program is based on the following premises.
First, there is multidimensionality to education, research, and training in gerontology. Thus, a ﬂexible
modular program was developed that was geared to
students’ individual needs. Second, it is important to
educate professionals and potential academic and research cadre to answer the growing and complex needs
of a heterogeneous and diverse aging population, based
a holistic approach. Thus, there is a strong emphasis on
research, policy, and management to promote understanding of issues like elders’ autonomy and quality of

257

life. The curriculum is geared toward the allied health
professions, the medical and legal professions, economists, social and behavioral sciences, life sciences, social
workers, educators, architects, and those seeking a new
career pathway.
The emphasis in the program is on excellence. Thus,
those admitted to the program have achieved the top
academic standards of the highest grades in their
undergraduate studies, scored high grades on an
English-proﬁciency examination, and presented highquality recommendations.
The establishment of the Master of Gerontology
program is in many ways an innovative endeavor in
Israel, where for many years only a disperse array of
courses in aging was offered and gerontology was
a low-prestige study area. The vested interests of many
professionals in the ﬁeld created barriers and opposition
for building such a department. I worked on developing
it and obtaining collaboration, both on the academic
level and the practice arena, for a number of years to
overcome such opposition. The program is also innovative compared with other programs around the
globe because it emphasizes so strongly the interdisciplinary nature of studies, the response to unique needs
of heterogeneous aging populations by strongly incorporating issues of ethnicity, immigration, comparative cross-cultural and cross-national research, and the
needed practice skills, such as case management, to
work with these populations.
It is innovative because it offers a very rich and
diversiﬁed range of courses in the social, behavioral,
psychological, medical, legal, economic, and physiological aspects of aging, policy planning, organization, and
management of services. It poses a challenging experience for participants and is tailored to individual and
small groups’ needs (e.g., collaborating with the
Department of Asian Studies at the university to offer
a student from Japan, now living in Israel, a special
reading course on elders in Japan).
It is innovative as it is ﬂexible and continuously
changing, based on feedback from the service network
and the students. This ﬂexibility is expressed, for
example, in the newly developed program for physicians. This unique program (for which my colleagues
and I did not ﬁnd a parallel elsewhere) is geared toward
training general practitioners (about 2,000 around the
country), family physicians (today close to 1,000),
directors of community health clinics, and those
working in institutional settings (a few hundred) who
did not specialize in geriatrics and probably would not
do so in the future. However, the clients of a large
number of these individuals are elderly adults and their
families. The program aims to upgrade their knowledge
level in gerontology and geriatrics and advance their
expertise by updating their knowledge in writing
scientiﬁc papers and conducting evaluations and research. This special program includes, in addition to the
general curriculum, expanded modules in geriatrics and
management with courses such as geriatric assessment,
clinical issues in geriatrics, and geriatric community
care, and it exposes individuals to social gerontology
and research.

The program is innovative in the sense that it aims
for all students not only to generate, evaluate, and
effectively disseminate new and existing knowledge and
best practices, but also to train others and to identify
priority gaps in knowledge for practice and policy
development.
Three strategies were adopted to further the development of the department. The ﬁrst was to build as
broad an interdisciplinary faculty as possible, which
was accomplished by assembling a committed staff of
social gerontologists, social workers, sociologists,
psychologists, and geriatricians, and a biologist, psychobiologist, policy planner, philosopher, architect,
environmental designer, and lawyer. The faculty
includes 2 full-time staff, 3 part-time members, and
another 12 lecturers who teach a course or two but are
not permanent members. However, all members of the
faculty are very dedicated and involved in all activities.
The second strategy was to strengthen the links between
the university and community through consultation
with top management and policy makers and actively
involve the major service organizations. The third
strategy was to build a strong research base through
close collaboration with the Center for Research and
Study of Aging. Such collaboration allows students to
work on their research theses and become involved in
studies conducted by faculty. A large number of our
students received prestigious awards and scholarships
both from within the university and from outside
funding agencies.
As Tofﬂer (1990) pointed out, the struggle to develop
standards, whether in the academic, political, economic, or technological realms, will determine the
promotion of distinct bodies of knowledge in disciplines
and professions. Conceivably, it will alter accepted
gerontology perceptions and propel the ﬁeld toward
professionalization. Therefore, the establishment of
a new educational department necessitates the consideration of the standards for knowledge development
and dissemination.

Standards and Challenges
Sivan (1995) provided a useful multidimensional
approach, in the educational area, by positing the
following four standards.
The ﬁrst standard is the level of development and
promotion of knowledge—from the individual level
through the organizational and supraorganizational to
the national and international. The curricula of the
program are geared toward this by offering interventions on the microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel and
cross-national research options.
The second standard is the goal: Does it aim to
simplify complex processes and facilitate their understanding; enhance communication and create a common language or unity among various professionals
in order to achieve harmony and protect users of the
knowledge; or inﬂuence the value system regarding the
ﬁxing of goals? The curriculum ﬁrst exposes students to
the interdisciplinary nature of gerontology through the
array of courses and then exposes the students to an
258

integrative, interdisciplinary seminar mandatory for all
students that is geared toward building a common
professional language among the various health and
social care professionals.
The third standard is inﬂuence: Does the knowledge
development and dissemination exert a constructive,
positive inﬂuence on the ﬁeld, or is its inﬂuence unknown? The program has already upgraded the level of
the service system and the academic bases, as outlined in
the paragraphs that follow.
The fourth standard is patronage: Is there a patron,
and if so does it consist of a single body or several, and
is there an existing mandate for the ﬁeld? The Council
of Higher Education in Israel, the University of Haifa,
the Israeli Association of Gerontology, and the major
service networks are actively involved.
The Department of Gerontology aims to relate to the
aforementioned standards.

Level of Development and Promotion of
Knowledge
In the United States, for example, the ﬁeld has been
organizationally institutionalized since the 1970s, with
the establishment of the Association for Gerontology in
Higher Education. Currently in Israel, education and
training as a specialized ﬁeld of study are in the
developmental process, as developers learn from programs abroad but adapt them to our culture and values.
The department aims both to create new knowledge
bases through the advancement of students’ research
skills, supporting their theses and research projects,
and to disseminate this knowledge through the active
involvement of faculty and students in conferences and
publications. In addition, each year we hold at least
three large workshops for national audiences, which
are organized by faculty and students together. For
example, the next workshop is planned for 600 family
physicians working in the largest HMO in northern
Israel, presenting state-of-the-art developments in geriatrics and gerontology. Furthermore, each semester two
faculty–student seminars are held, in which both groups
present the latest research or practice developments.

Goal
The development of gerontological topics and their
entrenchment in the curricula are inﬂuenced by societal
values regarding aging, and those of various professionals. Questions then arise such as this: Should the
goal be to prepare a cadre devoted to training, a cadre
for teaching and research, or a cadre for service management? Our goal is to train all such individuals to
assume leadership roles in the ﬁeld of aging that were
lacking in Israel. Thus, so far, the emphasis has been on
research and management. Future directions are to
develop modules like policy and administration, law
and aging, and family and intergenerational relations.
Another issue is determining the main topics and
study areas. The program is ﬂexible enough to understand the need to develop, for example, new practice
skills in management. Thus, this year a ﬁeld practicum
The Gerontologist

of 50 hr (to be expanded next year to 100 hr) was
developed for practitioners, with a focus on policy
and administration. Within the practicum, students
are working with directors of different agencies, such
as a rehabilitative hospital for the aged or a local
association for the aged, to learn micropolicy mechanisms and foundations for assessment and evaluation
of policy outcomes. The students’ projects centered on
evaluating outcomes of physiotherapy rehabilitation for
elders’ quality of life, or preparing a new ‘‘blueprint’’
for a hot line for elderly immigrants.
The program contains two tracks—a thesis track
with 36 hr of credit and a research thesis. This track
usually takes 3 years to complete. Here are some
examples of some of research theses: the perception of
grandparenthood: comparing the grandchildren of
holocaust survivors with those of nonsurvivors; knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease among Arab–Israeli elders;
the relations of physiotherapists’ knowledge and
attitudes to age bias in elder care; and knowledge and
referral patterns of dietitians regarding osteoporosis.
Most students, so far, have chosen the thesis track. In
the nonthesis track, which takes 2 years, 48 hr of credit
and a ﬁnal (miniresearch) paper are required. The
program includes the following: basic interdisciplinary
studies; research; management; interventions, both
microlevel and macrolevel; and general electives.
Basic Interdisciplinary Studies.—Mandatory for all
students are these studies: Social and Cultural Aspects
of Aging; Psychology of Aging; and an integrative
interdisciplinary seminar. Students must take two of
the following courses: The Biology of Aging; Physiology
of Aging; and Epidemiology of Aging.
Research.—Mandatory for all students are these
studies: Research Methods in Aging; Advanced Statistics
and Computers; a research thesis seminar (thesis track);
and a seminar for the ﬁnal paper (nonthesis track). In
2005, Qualitative Research Methods will be added.
Management.—Mandatory for all students are
these studies: Introduction to Management in Services
for the Aged; Interdisciplinary Team Work; Organizational Behavior; and Management of Health Systems
for the Elderly.
Interventions: Microlevel and Mesolevel.—Students
must take Psychogeriatrics; Clinical Interventions With
the Aged; Intergenerational Relations in the Aging
Family; Assessment of the Elderly; Working With
Holocaust Survivors; and Community Interventions
With Various Aged Populations.
Interventions: Macrolevel.—All students must take
Aging Policy; Law and Aging; and Welfare and Health
Services: Organization and Operation. Electives are
The Pension System; Ethics in Aging; and Architectural
Planning.
There is a practicum in Policy and Service Planning.
It is currently 50 hr, although it will be expanded in 2005
Vol. 45, No. 2, 2005

259

to 100 hr, and it is supervised by directors of services
with a faculty member in charge. It is required for
students on the nonthesis track, and it is elective for
those on the thesis track.
General Electives.—There are several general elective courses: Sleep and Sleep Disorders; Study of
Emotions; Art and Aging; Health and Illness; Physical
Education in Aging; and Loss and Grief. In 2005, two
courses will be added: Elder Abuse, and Environment
and Aging.

Inﬂuence
The program appears to be effective, exerting
a positive, albeit yet insufﬁciently widespread, inﬂuence
in training top professionals and preparing a potential
academic cadre. This inﬂuence is reﬂected, for example,
in the number of graduates who hold key positions in
health and welfare services, like a head nurse in a general
hospital or head of social work services in a large longterm-care facility. The individuals advanced to these
positions after graduation. This inﬂuence is also reﬂected in the number of new programs established by
graduates, such as the introduction of gerontology into
a high school curriculum, or building strong links between a geriatric department and community clinics.
Furthermore, many students who did not work in the
ﬁeld are currently absorbed in the labor market, holding
such positions as director of a large day care center or
being responsible for occupational therapy in a large
home for the aged. Thus they become inﬂuential professionals in the service network. After close negotiations, today both the Ministry of Health and the
National Insurance Institute recognize that our students’ training makes them ﬁt to obtain positions in such
places as nursing companies that operate under the Long
Term Care Insurance Law, or they recognize the studies
as being cause for additional bonus to their salaries.
Some graduates were integrated into academic departments such as occupational therapy and nursing at
the University of Haifa, whereas some had started their
doctoral studies in the United States and at Haifa. Furthermore, a physician who graduated with the ﬁrst
graduating class was recruited as a faculty member for
the new program for physicians. Many students participate actively in national conferences and workshops on
aging, presenting their theses and publishing in various
referred journals in Israel and abroad.
Another element reﬂecting the impact of the department is the close contact with the international research
community, through close association with the International Association of Gerontology (IAG) and the
European Behavioral, Social Science and Research Section of the European Gerontological Region (of which
I am the former head). The program was presented at
various international conferences and received warm
feedback, especially at the European Congress of
Gerontology in Barcelona in 2003, and at the IAG
workshop on Graduate Education in Gerontology
Worldwide in Richmond, VA in 2004.

The impact of the department is also shown by the
increasing number of top candidates who apply; there
are between 100 and 120 candidates each year,
‘‘forcing’’ us to admit more than planned. Originally,
our mandate was to admit 20 students each year.
However, during the third year, we accepted 25; in the
fourth year, 30; and in 2003–2004, 40 students. All
admitted students are of high caliber.

Patronage
The department has managed to obtain the recognition of the Council for Higher Education, and the major
ministries and service organizations for the elderly in
Israel. The University of Haifa and the Faculty of
Welfare and Health Studies, where it is located, are very
supportive, expanding its academic staff and providing
additional resources each year. In addition, ESHEL, the
largest governmental service organization in Israel, is
highly supportive and involved: ESHEL’s director
teaches in the program and is developing and heading
the policy practicum.

Conclusions
This article describes the rationale, goals, and standards for development and operation of the relatively
newly established Master of Gerontology program at
the University of Haifa in Israel. The need for the program and the recognition of this need, by the Council of
Higher Education and the professional community,
have signiﬁcantly affected the attitudes and learning
experiences of the students. The program exerts an
inﬂuence both in research advancements and within the
service network for the elderly population, introducing
new practice skills and intervention techniques.
The perception of gerontology as a discipline aiming
at professionalization stems from the general consensus
among researchers and professionals that, although
a body of academic knowledge exists, gerontology by its
very nature embraces knowledge from a variety of
disciplines, which it incorporates and integrates (Hendricks & Hendricks, 1986). With this, there is a consensus as well over the existence of a core body of
knowledge (Johnson et al., 1980). Such a conceptualization prompts the development of distinctive curricula
with an interdisciplinary thrust, which at the same time
attempt to achieve harmonization and create a common
language among professionals. This provided the basis
for the creation of the Master of Gerontology program
with its innovative approach, emphasizing interdisciplinary, research-based education, and developing
a ﬂexible, modular, rich, and diversiﬁed program to
answer the needs of heterogeneous aged population
groups and introduce new programs like the unique
program for physicians.
For any program, and especially a new department,
evaluation and feedback are constantly necessary,
prompting questions about the multidisciplinarity
versus the interdisciplinarity of the curricula. Today,
the multiple and complex needs of the elderly population
are understood to require interdisciplinary collabora260

tion, and programs and learning experiences must be
developed to facilitate a better understanding of the
various roles and expertise required (Deveau, Blumberg,
& Joshi, 1997). The master’s department is geared
toward such interdisciplinary education.
The success of such a unique program can be attributed to a number of variables. A long and comprehensive planning process was activated, in which support
from academia and professionals was sought. During
this process, resources were assembled, involvement of
major service organizations and high-level academic
faculty was sought, and marketing strategies were
implemented. This included meetings and repeated
contacts with the relevant top-ranking faculty at the
university, the Center for Research and Study of Aging,
the Israeli Gerontological Association, and top-level
management in the health and welfare ministries and the
service network. These efforts created valuable partnerships and the ability to evaluate multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary experiences and share ideas for curriculum development and recruitment of academic faculty.
The development of such an innovative program
poses a number of challenges. First, there is the need to
constantly evaluate the content and structure, through
continued feedback from faculty, students, and practitioners, and to expand the program. This is achieved
through the allocation of additional resources. In the
current economic climate in Israel this is especially
difﬁcult, but we managed to expand both the number of
faculty and students and create a new special program
for physicians. Second, we must ‘‘toss in’’ new ideas and
new directions for further development, like the
introduction of the policy practicum. Third, we must
constantly keep abreast with new research knowledge
and develop international and national exchange and
collaboration. This is achieved through close working
relations with the Center for Research and Study of
Aging, which has a wide network of such international
and national contacts. For example, during the past 3
years, the Department of Gerontology worked closely
with the research center that coordinated and activated
a cross-national, ﬁve-country study on quality of life of
the aged, funded by the European Commission.
In summary, the Department of Gerontology attempts to relate to the emerging gerontological paradigm, containing two basic elements: time-related
change on the microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel,
and the interaction between them (Morgan & Kunkel,
1998). This is what Ferraro (1997) calls the ‘‘gerontological imagination.’’
