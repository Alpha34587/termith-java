Abstract
To investigate the etiology of hole formation in the gerbil and rat central auditory system, organotypic cultures were grown in
control and veratridine-containing media. The latter condition is known to increase neuronal activity. Tissue was obtained at
postnatal day 6 and grown for 6-9 days in vitro, a period prior to the formation of holes in vivo. In both rats and gerbils, veratridine
led to the appearance of large numbers of holes, and these were phenotypically similar to those found in vivo. These results support
the idea that hole formation is an activity-dependent phenomenon, and suggest that it is not restricted to the mature gerbil auditory
system.

1. Introduction

A well investigated, but poorly understood, phenomenon in the gerbil central auditory brain stem is the
developmental appearance of 'holes'. These 'holes'
have variously been referred to as microcysts, lesions,
lacunae, cavitations, vacuoles, tissue voids, and spongioform degeneration (Schwartz and Karnofsky, 1988;
Czibulka and Schwartz, 1991, 1993; Keithley et aI.,
1989; Moore and Kitzes, 1986; Ostapoff and Morest,
1989; Statler et aI., 1988, 1990; and see review in
McGinn and Faddis, 1997). There is some anatomical
evidence to suggest that the holes are related to neuronal degeneration (Ostapoff and Morest, 1989), particularly in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (pVCN).
However, a quantitative evaluation of the PVCN indicates that both neuronal soma size and number remain
unchanged during the time when the number of holes is
increasing (Czibulka and Schwartz, 1991). Holes are a

phenotypically diverse group of structures in vivo, and
have been associated with both glia and neuronal processes. The diversity of hole origins in axons, dendrites
and glia are illustrated in Czibulka and Schwartz, 1993
in Figs. 5A, 5B and 6 respectively. To date, studies that
have employed the gerbil fail to demonstrate significant
anomalies of structure, function, or maturation in comparison to other species (Finck et aI., 1972;Ryan, 1976;
Smith, 1977, 1979; Ozdamar and Dallos, 1978; Goodman et aI., 1982; Ryan et aI., 1982; Frisina et aI., 1982,
1985, 1990a,b; Nordeen et aI., 1983; Harris and Dallos,
1984; Melzer, 1984; Woolf and Ryan, 1984, 1985; Semple and Kitzes, 1985, 1987; Dolan et aI., 1985a,b; Axelsson et aI., 1986; Sanes et aI., 1987, 1992a,b; Sanes
and Wooten, 1987; Sanes and Rubel, 1988; Spitzer and
Semple, 1991, 1993, 1995; Sanes and Siverls, 1991;
Burkard et aI., 1993; Sanes, 1990, 1993; Huang et aI.,
1995). Nonetheless, negative findings do not in any way
preclude the possibility that stimulus processing may in
some way be adversely affected by the holes. Therefore,
the functional ramifications remain to be determined.
The holes first appear in the gerbil cochlear nucleus

between 25-50 days postnatal (Statler et aI., 1990), and
become apparent in the superior olivary complex by
approximately 10-12 weeks postnatal (Ostapoff and
Morest, 1989) when they are obvious in the PVCN
but occupying less than 5% of its area (Czibulka and
Schwartz, 1991). Several groups have reported that
acoustically isolated or deafened animals exhibit a reduced number of holes in the central auditory brainstem (McGinn and Faddis, 1987, 1988, 1994; McGinn
et aI., 1990; Moore and Kitzes, 1986; Statler et aI.,
1990; Czibulka and Schwartz, 1991). Therefore, gerbils
with the poorest hearing have the most normal looking
central auditory gross anatomy. The age and activity
dependence of appearance of holes suggest that the etiology is related to the cumulative synaptic or electrical
activity within the affected structures. During the course
of explant culture studies (Sanes and Hafidi, 1996), it
became apparent that one growth condition favored the
appearance of holes and might provide insight into the
mechanisms underlying hole formation. The present
study presents these findings for two species, gerbil
and rat.

2. Materials and methods
The experimental protocols were approved by the
NYU and Yale Animal Care and Use Committees
and were carried out in compliance with NIH guidelines
for the use of animals in research. The explant procedures used were largely adapted from an established
protocol (Stoppini et aI., 1991). Explant procedures
were performed under a laminar flow hood (Baker),
and equipment was UV irradiated for at least 1 h prior
to the dissection. All microdissection tools and containers were sterilized in ethanol and flamed, or were presterilized disposable plastic. Brain slices of 300-400 11m
were obtained from gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) or
Albino rats aged 6-8 days postnatal (P) in a manner
identical to that previously described (Hafidi et aI.,
1995). The explants were transferred onto a filter insert
(Millipore) within a multiwell plate containing sterilized
medium. Two different culture media were employed.
The first medium contained: 25% Horse Serum, 50%
Minimum Essential Medium, 25% Earle's Balanced
Salt Solution, 0.5 g/100 m1 glucose, and 1% 200 mM
L-glutamine (GIBCO). The second medium was identical except for the addition of 10-5 M veratridine (3veratroylveracevine; Fluka) , a pharmacological agent
which is known to open Na" channels (Ulbricht,
1969; Catterall, 1975; Barnes and Hille, 1988). This
agent has been successfully employed in previous in
vitro developmental studies to promote the differentiation of a specific neuronal phenotype (Cohen-Cory et
aI., 1991, 1993; Lu et aI., 1991; Eaton et aI., 1995;
Tanaka and Koike, 1995). The explants were placed

137

in a humidified incubator (Forma) with 5% CO2 at
36,SOC, and supplied with fresh medium every 24 h,
eventually thinning to 100-150 11m. To prevent excessive glial cell and fibroblast proliferation, the explants
were exposed to a medium containing 5-fluoro-2' -deoxyuridine, 10 11M; uridine, 10 11M; cytosine ~-D-ara­
binofuranoside, 10 11M for 24 h at 4 d in vitro. Cultures
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or a mixed aldehyde fixative, usually 2% paraformaldehyde and 2%
glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer. Cultures were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in alcohol
and embedded flat in epoxy resin on slides. Photographs were taken of the whole cultures before they
were remounted on stubs and sectioned. Semithin and
ultrathin sections were obtained, and the latter were
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for observation under a Philips 300 electron microscope.

3. Results
Explant cultures included portions of superior olivary nuclei, including the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), the lateral superior olive (LSO),
the medial superior olive (MSO), and the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN). This preparation has been used
to examine the effect of inhibitory transmission on dendrite branching patterns (Sanes and Hafidi, 1996). As
shown in Fig. lA, C, the presence of a substantial population of holes was very apparent at low magnifications in all gerbil slices cultured in the presence of
10-5 M veratridine. Holes were even visible to the
naked eye. Holes became obvious in the tissue roughly
3--4 days after explantation in veratridine-containing
media and remained throughout the period the cultures
were maintained. Control cultures had a very different
appearance with only a few holes detectable (Fig. 1B).
The holes were found throughout the cultured slices,
but were somewhat unevenly distributed. Fewer holes
were obvious within the region of the LSO, while more
were found in periolivary areas. Semithin sections demonstrated that there was survival of both neurons and
glia in the cultures during the period examined, 4-9
days in vitro (DIY). Some degenerating cells are always
found in slice cultures, but these cannot account for the
dramatic differences in the numbers of holes between
the veratridine-treated and control cultures. Veratridine
was originally included in the culture medium because it
improved the survival of neurons (Cohen-Cory et aI.,
1991).
The effect of veratridine was not restricted to gerbils.
When the superior olive from rat pups of the same
postnatal age were prepared in control and veratridine-containing media, a similar result was obtained.
Qualitatively there were fewer large holes in rat than
in gerbil veratridine treated cultures. Fig. 2 illustrates

the distribution of holes in a 1 urn slice through a rat
culture.
At the light microscopic level holes were characteristically clear and many appeared totally empty. Membrane figures, some cellular debris or trabeculae were
detectable in some of the holes. Some hole profiles were
closely associated with cell bodies, but others appeared
among bundles of fibers. In short, holes displayed all of
the characteristics of those described in the normal gerbil cochlear nucleus. (See Figs. 1C and 5 in Czibulka
and Schwartz, 1993.) An initial attempt to quantify
differences in the number of holes between control
and experimental material by camera lucida drawing
and digitizing tablet revealed an extreme difference in
numbers, composed of a large difference in the numbers
of medium to large holes which can be clearly appreciated in photomicrographs but also including a very
large number of very small holes. Given the difficulty
of drawing all the small holes and the arbitrary nature

of the absolute number as a function of veratridine
dosage we felt that the clear photographic evidence of
the differences was sufficient to document the qualitative aspects of the phenomenon.
To further define the morphology of these induced
holes we examined thin sections from the same slices at
the electron microscopic level. As shown in Fig. 3, the
characteristics of the holes in the veratridine treated
cultures were indistinguishable from that of typical
holes found in normal 12 month old gerbil PVCN
(e.g. see Figs. lC and 6 in Czibulka and Schwartz,
1993).
4. Discussion

The description of holes in the gerbil auditory brainstem includes some heterogeneity of features present,
especially across development, ranging from small clear

IR Schwartz et at.! Hearing Research 111 (1997) 136-142

areas of swelling within neuronal or glial processes in
young animals to very large membrane bound spaces
containing myelin figures and trabeculae in mature animals. The differences in features observed in vivo is
consistent with their representing a diverse group of
stages as well as of structures. At a minimum, the morphology of holes in gerbil and rat organotypic slices
form a reliable subset of the phenotypes observed in
vivo.
The description of holes in the adult gerbil auditory
brainstem embraces a number of observations that are
suggestive of a degenerative mechanism (Ostapoff and
Morest, 1989). For example, micrographic evidence in
support of neuron cell death shows a pyknotic nucleus
within a soma-sized hole (e.g. see Fig. 2 in Ostapoff and
Morest, 1989). However, there is no quantitative finding to establish neuronal atrophy or cell death beyond
that which is normally observed in aged animals. In

fact, it has been demonstrated that PVCN neuron
soma cross sectional area and density (i.e. number of
cells per Ilm2) are stable from 3-12 months, whereas the
size and density of holes increases dramatically during
the same time (Czibulka and Schwartz, 1991). Moreover, several investigators have shown that the appearance of holes is dependent upon the acoustic environment, and presumably driven activity (McGinn and
Faddis, 1987, 1994; McGinn et aI., 1990; Moore and
McGinn, 1990; Moore and Kitzes, 1986; Statler et aI.,
1990; Czibulka and Schwartz, 1991). Further, two studies focusing on the relationship between glia and holes
have documented a rather close association between
them (Czibulka and Schwartz, 1993; Faddis and
McGinn, 1993).
The present results support three conclusions. First,
the data provide support for the hypothesis that holes
are dependent upon electrical activity, although it does

not discriminate between a direct effect of Na" entry or
an enhancement of transmitter release. The compound
used in this study, veratridine, slows sodium channel
inactivation and leads to membrane hyperexcitability
(Ulbricht, 1969; Catterall, 1975; Barnes and Hille,
1988). Veratridine has been used successfully to promote survival or differentiation in vitro by several investigators, and it was these results that initially
prompted our use of the substance (Cohen-Cory et
aI., 1991, 1993; Lu et aI., 1991; Eaton et aI., 1995;
Tanaka and Koike, 1995). Veratridine has also been
shown to increase glutamate release both in vivo and

in vitro (Stier et aI., 1996). It is this property, which
mimics the effects of excitatory stimulation, that may
trigger the events leading to hole formation. In the
present study, veratridine induced the formation of
easily observed holes in cultured brain slices within
about 3-4 days of explantation. Tissue grown in control
media was qualitatively different, having only a few,
small holes upon close inspection.
Secondly, our results suggest that age is not a critical
determinant of the appearance of holes. In the gerbils,
holes are not obvious in the superior olivary complex
until approximately P90, but cultured slices from P6-8

IR Schwartz et al.! Hearing Research 111 (1997) 136-142

animals exhibited holes within 3--4 days of explantation.
Therefore, the tissue is competent to express this phenotype long before it occurs in vivo. There are some
latent developmental events that may provide a clue to
this discrepancy. For example, a proteoglycan whose
expression is, itself, activity dependent (i.e. CAT-30l)
(Kalb and Hockfield, 1988, 1990, 1992) reaches adult
levels of expression on an extended time course in auditory brainstem nuclei (Yao et aI., 1995; Yao, 1994).
Thirdly, the present results indicate that the ability to
form activity-dependent holes is not restricted to gerbils. Cultured slices from neonatal rats of the same age
also displayed holes when grown in veratridine-containing media. Additional evidence of the generality of the
phenomenon comes from its demonstration in other
species such as the kangaroo rat which has similar
good low frequency hearing to the gerbil (McGinn
and Faddis, 1997) and in aged Sprague Dawley rats
and aged Macaca mulatta monkeys (Feldman, 1994).
It has also been noted in other parts of the central
nervous system (Feldman, 1994).
In summary, the extensive literature supporting normal development and near normal function of the gerbil central auditory system, the data suggesting a limited amount of degenerative changes in neuronal and
glial processes (McGinn and Faddis, 1997) and the
probability that neuronal somatic degeneration is not
significantly greater than that found during the life
span of any other species (Czibulka and Schwartz,
1991), together with the present results in neonatal tissue suggest that hole formation in gerbils is not primarily a degenerative process, but an interesting, and specialized rapid response to the demands of maintaining
optimum synaptic transmission in a highly driven system which may, over time, cause secondary and minor
degenerative changes.
