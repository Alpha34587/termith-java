Is Segregation Bad for Your Health?

Michael R. Kramer and Carol R. Hogue

Accepted for publication April 7, 2009.

For decades, racial residential segregation has been observed to vary with health outcomes for African Americans, although only recently has interest increased in the public health literature. Utilizing a systematic review of
the health and social science literature, the authors consider the segregation-health association through the lens of
4 questions of interest to epidemiologists: How is segregation best measured? Is the segregation-health association socially or biologically plausible? What evidence is there of segregation-health associations? Is segregation
a modiﬁable risk factor? Thirty-nine identiﬁed studies test an association between segregation and health outcomes. The health effects of segregation are relatively consistent, but complex. Isolation segregation is associated
with poor pregnancy outcomes and increased mortality for blacks, but several studies report health-protective
effects of living in clustered black neighborhoods net of social and economic isolation. The majority of reviewed
studies are cross-sectional and use coarse measures of segregation. Future work should extend recent developments in measuring and conceptualizing segregation in a multilevel framework, build upon the ﬁndings and
challenges in the neighborhood-effects literature, and utilize longitudinal data sources to illuminate opportunities
for public health action to reduce racial disparities in disease.

With an eye toward these 4 areas of measurement, mechanism, association, and policy implications, we searched
MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, and
the Web of Science databases in September 2008 using
variants of the term ‘‘residential’’ combined with variants
of the term ‘‘segregation,’’ resulting in 2,564 citations. Important literature exists (and more is needed) to enable
understanding of economic segregation, segregation of
Hispanics and Asians, and the role of segregation in rural
areas, but these topics were not the subject of this literature review. The largest body of literature concerns health
and the residential segregation of blacks and whites in
metropolitan areas of the United States; we therefore focused primarily on these studies and reports. A brief review of the history of black-white segregation in the
United States precedes attention to the 4 questions structuring this paper.

INTRODUCTION

In 1950, Dr. Alfred Yankauer observed that the infant
mortality rate for black babies and white babies in New York
City increased as the concentration of blacks in the mother’s
neighborhood of residence increased (1). While social scientists had been observing racial and ethnic residential settlement patterns for some time before this, Yankauer was the
ﬁrst to link racial residential segregation with population
health. Only in the past 15 years has public health interest
rekindled in considering whether segregation can explain
longstanding racial and economic disparities in health, as
evidenced by the growth in the number of publications in
biomedical and social science journals (Figure 1).
David Williams has called segregation a ‘‘fundamental
cause’’ of health disparities because of the manner in which
it differentially sorts individuals into social and economic
environments on the basis of race and class (2). Widespread
health disparities in the United States remain difﬁcult to
explain (3, 4), and thus far difﬁcult to ameliorate, making
claims of a ‘‘fundamental cause’’ appealing. This review
assesses the evidence for this claim by considering 4 broad

HISTORY OF SEGREGATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Residential segregation is the degree to which groups of
people categorized on a variety of scales (race, ethnicity,
income) occupy different space within urban areas, and
the process that creates this differential spatial distribution
(5). Segregation in US cities is neither new nor unique to any
one ethnic or racial group. New European immigrants to US
urban areas frequently resided in relatively homogenous
ethnic enclaves, a process that may be a critical component
of assimilation (6). This segregation of new immigrants
typically subsides within a generation as economic opportunity and upward mobility lead to fuller integration. Yet,
for black Americans, segregation increased throughout
much of the 20th century.
Cutler et al. (7) portray black-white residential segregation in the 20th century in 3 distinct periods. The ﬁrst, the
birth of the ghetto, spanned from 1890 to 1940 (Cutler et al.
distinguish ‘‘ghetto’’ as a largely black, segregated area, as
opposed to a slum, which denotes quality of living conditions). Large-scale migration of rural southern blacks to
urban areas in the Northeast was driven by changes in agricultural practices in the South and demand for manual labor
in the industrial North. While the average urban black in
1890 lived in a neighborhood that was 27% black, by 1940
this black percentage had increased to 43% (7). This period
of increasing racial density parallels the pattern of any new
immigrant group and results largely from an afﬁnity of newcomers to live near other newcomers. Congregating in
neighborhoods offered opportunity for job leads, connections to cultural and religious institutions, and social support. Limited evidence of housing markets during this
period suggests this early segregation may have been driven
as much by black choice as by structured limitation to other
options.
The period from 1940 to 1970 was one of consolidation
and expansion of the urban black ghetto. While further miEpidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

gration of rural blacks into southern and northern urban
areas continued to expand the size of the black population
in many cities, racial tensions were increasing (8). In a process Cutler et al. call collective action racism, housing markets
were manipulated by law, restrictive covenant, and overt
acts of intimidation by whites to maintain and increase separation. According to one estimate, 80% of housing deeds in
some areas included restrictive covenants regarding race (7,
9). Massey and Denton (10) argue that it was this period of
sanctioned and institutionalized racism, which they likened
to South-African apartheid, that formed the segregation that
persists to today. By most measures, black-white residential
segregation peaked in 1970, when the average urban black
person lived in a neighborhood that was 68% black (7).
Since 1970, segregation has decreased modestly. This
trend resulted mostly from the movement of some black
families to previously all-white areas rather than from the
integration of largely black areas. While segregation may
have decreased overall, the results of previous decades have
persisted in terms of isolation and poverty concentration for
many urban black residents. There are some areas (particularly in the South and West) in which middle-class black
families have integrated into white neighborhoods, while
poor black families have become increasingly isolated physically and economically in areas that suffer from infrastructure disinvestment (11).
The Civil Rights Act (Fair Housing Act) of 1968 prohibited discrimination in housing sales and rentals and thus
theoretically stopped the collective-action racism that
shaped segregation during the preceding decades. Nevertheless, ongoing ﬁnancial and interview audit studies demonstrate that redlining (the illegal process of systematically
denying loans to certain portions of a city) and outright
racial discrimination persist today in shaping urban housing
markets (12). Cutler et al. (7) argue that, in this third historical period from 1970 forward, decentralized racism became the operative process maintaining segregation.

180 Kramer and Hogue

During this phase, white avoidance (due to racism or to
escape from economically crumbling central cities) may
be most operative in maintaining segregation, as evidenced
by whites paying more for comparable housing in predominantly white neighborhoods and survey data that blacks
more than whites desire greater residential integration
(64% of blacks vs. 40% of whites in 2007) (13).
This brief review of the history of 20th-century segregation in the United States points out 2 important features
relevant to the health researcher. First, the black-white urban
residential segregation seen today is distinct from any other
ethnic or group segregation in the United States, and perhaps elsewhere in the world, and therefore reﬂects a process
of social stratiﬁcation that is both historically situated and
uniquely American. Second, because the mechanisms driving segregation varied over time, the health implications of
segregation may vary temporally as well. For example, the
health effects associated with the early 20th century ethnic
enclaves of new black immigrants to the North were likely
different from those experienced by residents of the hypersegregated cities in the latter 3 decades of the 20th century,
where poverty concentration and infrastructure decay
dominate.
MEASURING RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION

The nonrandom clustering of social groups in space is not
inherently good or bad. To affect population health, segregation must have more to it than the departure from random
distribution of housing, and yet it is precisely this patterning
of residents that is typically measured in segregation indices. One challenge in conceptualizing segregation is that its
social and health-relevant effects are often described in
terms of the process of segregation—a series of forces that
differentially allot individuals into residential environments
and economic opportunities on the basis of race (10, 14)—
as opposed to the condition or state of segregation, which is
the description of spatial residential patterns at a point in
time (15). Many studies essentially estimate the degree to
which measuring the state approximates what we believe
the process to be.
The crudest measure of segregation (used by Yankauer
(1) in 1950, and by many investigators currently) is the
proportion of a group (e.g., whites) in a given neighborhood
(e.g., census tract), often termed neighborhood racial composition. It is easily operationalized and appears intuitive to
the reader, but it says nothing about the distribution of people in space, is invariant to population density in a neighborhood, and does not specify a reference against which to
measure the neighborhood (e.g., a neighborhood that is
30% black means different things in a city that is 1% black
and one that is 30% black). In other words, the composition
of a given neighborhood is independent of the residential
patterning of the larger city.
For these reasons, most social scientists utilize measures
that acknowledge 2 scales of geography: subareas (e.g.,
neighborhoods) situated within larger overall geographic
areas (e.g., cities or metropolitan areas). Segregation is then
expressed as a comparison of the subareas to the overall
area, commonly in the form of a population-weighted aver-

age across all neighborhoods. Although central cities, counties, and even states have been used as the larger geographic
context, the Metropolitan Statistical Area could arguably be
the best larger context in which to situate neighborhoods.
The notion of sorting individuals into residential environments is largely a function of housing markets, and the
consequences of segregation discussed below are largely
related to labor markets. Metropolitan Statistical Areas are
units constructed by the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget
to deﬁne counties clustered around a central city deﬁned by
their degree of economic integration (16); in other words,
one goal of the Metropolitan Statistical Area deﬁnition is to
describe a discrete regional housing and labor market (17).
Segregation is most commonly conceived of as having 5
dimensions described by Massey and Denton (5): evenness
(the degree to which groups are evenly distributed in space),
isolation (the probability for interaction between members
of same vs. different racial groups in a given neighborhood),
concentration (the spatial density of a minority group in an
area), centralization (the degree to which a group is primarily located in the city core), and clustering (the grouping of
racially similar neighborhoods in space). Numerous indices
are intended to proxy each dimension, but 2 frequently encountered in the segregation literature are the dissimilarity
index—which measures evenness—and the isolation index
(sometimes represented as xP*x). The dissimilarity index
can be interpreted as the proportion of the minority group
that would have to move to another neighborhood to achieve
complete integration. This index ranges from 0 (complete
integration or evenness) to 1 (complete segregation). The
isolation index, on the other hand, measures the probability
that 2 individuals randomly drawn from the same neighborhood are of the same race, essentially estimating exposure or
isolation of one group to another. It also ranges from 0 (complete exposure) to 1 (complete isolation).
While the indices discussed by Massey and Denton (5)
dominate segregation research, critiques of the measures
exist (18). One important criticism is the reliance on census
tracts as proxies for neighborhoods. Although tracts have
been demonstrated to be reasonable small-area approximations for understanding health disparities (19, 20), in the
case of the inherently spatial concept of segregation, tracts
may be too arbitrary in terms of their boundaries and scale
(21–23). Speciﬁcally, mechanisms by which segregation impacts social and health outcomes may be operative at a different scale than is represented by the census tract.
Several investigators have proposed newer ‘‘spatial’’ versions of the traditional indices that utilize geographic information system software to estimate segregation by
varying neighborhood scales without relying on the tract
boundaries (21, 23–26). Approaches have included creation
of new indices as well as extending traditional indices such
as the isolation index and dissimilarity index to account for
scale and spatial orientation of one neighborhood to the
next. Early results demonstrate that both the absolute estimation of segregation and the relative ranking of cities
change when segregation is measured at different scales
(23, 27), suggesting potential misclassiﬁcation of exposure
if the scale measured is not conceptually wed to the intended
hypothesis.

One interesting result of eliminating the arbitrary reliance
on census tracts as the default scale of neighborhoods is that
the 5 dimensions of segregation collapse into 2 (18, 21).
Reardon (21) argues that the distinction between evenness
and neighborhood clustering is simply a matter of the scale
at which measures are calculated. Similarly, centralization
and concentration can be seen as special cases of the general
spectrum of evenness versus clustering of households,
which results in spatial evenness and spatial isolation as
2 general dimensions of residential segregation. Few studies
have utilized a spatial measure of segregation (28, 29), and it
remains to be seen whether these measures will prove to be
meaningfully different tools for understanding the association between segregation and health.
Although most studies identiﬁed used segregation measures for 2 groups, indices do exist for alternate conceptualizations. With increasingly multicultural cities, researchers’
interest may lie in the residential patterns of multiple racial
and ethnic groups simultaneously or the black-white patterns in the context of other groups (30). Multigroup segregation indices are logical extensions of the 2-group indices
mentioned above (31, 32). Segregation can also be measured
along an ordinal scale, as would be the case for understanding segregation across levels of family income (33, 34).

POTENTIAL SOCIAL/BIOLOGIC PATHWAYS FROM
SEGREGATION TO POPULATION HEALTH

A primary concern of epidemiologists regarding any
exposure-disease relation is its biologic (or social) plausibility:
through what causal pathway could an association be mediated? Four interconnected mechanisms (Figure 2) are comEpidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

monly hypothesized: 1) residential segregation begets
individual socioeconomic status, which itself is related to
health; 2) segregation perpetuates and reproduces unhealthy
neighborhood environments; 3) segregation modiﬁes social
capital for a city overall or for speciﬁc racial groups within
a city; and 4) segregation modiﬁes individual risk behaviors
or exposure to stressful stimuli (2, 35–37). Segregation is
often construed to affect minority communities differently
from majority communities, and, as such, these mechanisms
relate to possible mechanisms for varying racial disparities
in health. Evidence for each mechanism is reviewed in turn
below.
Segregation and individual socioeconomic status

A leading hypothesis is that the toxic effects of residential
segregation are due in part to the association of racial segregation with economically related consequences (11).
Strong evidence exists for an interaction of racial and economic segregation through spatial concentration of minority
poor people in urban areas. The majority of poor people in
the United States are white, yet most poor whites live in
economically integrated neighborhoods. In contrast, most
poor blacks live in poor neighborhoods (38). The propensity
for poor blacks to live in high-poverty neighborhoods has
been termed ‘‘double jeopardy’’ (39). In the United States in
2000, 1.4% of white children lived in poor families inside
poor neighborhoods, while 16.8% of black children experienced this double jeopardy. The average black child spends
50% of his or her ﬁrst 18 years of life in high-poverty neighborhoods, while the average white child spends 5% (40).
One of the most direct consequences of this spatial concentration of the poor is reduced educational opportunities,

182 Kramer and Hogue

because school options are primarily a function of neighborhood of residence. If all schools were equal, this issue would
be inconsequential, yet there is substantial evidence that
poor urban schools perform worse than suburban schools
on nearly all markers of quality, including curricular variety,
test scores, teacher and administrator experience, high
school completion, and the social environment including
violence, drugs, and teen pregnancy (2, 41, 42). In a study
on the racial gap in Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores,
metropolitan-level segregation explained one quarter of the
gap (approximately 45 points) (43). Growing up in morecompared with less-segregated neighborhoods negatively
affects adult educational attainment (44) and may inﬂuence
the academic performance of those who enter college (45).
One approach to estimating the causal component of segregation on the education gap is to use an instrumental variable analysis, in which a variable causally associated with
segregation, but unlikely to be associated with education, is
substituted in models. Cutler and Glaeser (46) used number
of rivers in a metropolitan area as an instrumental variable
for segregation, acknowledging the likely causal manner in
which topographic features such as rivers reduce intracity
migration and increase segregation. They found that segregation measured with the dissimilarity index was negatively
associated with adults having obtained high school and college degrees, and that the pattern of association held when
segregation was instrumented by rivers.
Segregation also reduces employment opportunities and
lowers income through a spatial mismatch of workers and
jobs. When education and skills are controlled for, black
residents in highly segregated cities are more likely to be
unemployed than black persons living in less-segregated
cities (47) and to spend more time searching for jobs
(48), and they are less likely to be self-employed (11, 49,
50). These effects are particularly strong for extremes of the
isolation and clustering dimensions. A review of urban employment and industry over 40 years concluded that the
degree of spatial mismatch was less explanatory of racial
disparities in employment than was the overall decrease in
urban manufacturing (51). However, another study testing
the spatial mismatch theory used employment records of the
US Postal Service, which, as an institution, has had large
processing facilities geographically ﬁxed in urban centers
throughout the post–World War II decades (52). In this analysis, degree of metropolitan segregation was unassociated
with racial composition of the US Postal Service workforce
in the 1940s–1960s. When centrally located urban jobs declined with the exodus of manufacturing in the 1970s, the
degree of city segregation and black employment at central
postal facilities became correlated, suggesting that racial
segregation in the past 30 years is associated with decreased
access to employment opportunity for many black families.
While poor blacks disproportionately experience the negative effects of segregation (53), middle-class blacks may
also suffer from residential segregation through limited
housing choices (54, 55), limited wealth accumulation
(56), and restrictions on upward mobility (57). Middle-class
blacks are more likely than poor blacks to live in lesssegregated neighborhoods, yet they often do not achieve
income-matched parity with whites in terms of neighbor-

hood quality, with blacks living in neighborhoods that are
older and have lower tax bases, and living among whites
who have a lower mean income than they do (58). In fact,
for blacks (compared with Hispanics or Asians), degree of
residential segregation is relatively independent of individual socioeconomic status (59).
Segregation and neighborhood socioeconomic
environment

Although segregation may limit individuals’ economic
opportunities, it could also produce neighborhoods that
are in and of themselves unhealthy. This hypothesized pathway links the segregation-health literature with the increasingly rich neighborhood effects–health literature in
a manner that may complement each. In recent years, a large
body of research has struggled to distinguish between the
population health impacts of neighborhood context versus
neighborhood composition (60–62). One important criticism of this literature is the limited ability to account for
selection into neighborhoods, a plausible confounder of the
contextual-health association (63). However, metropolitanlevel segregation may serve as one such distal sorting
mechanism that accounts for the differential assignment of
neighborhood environment.
Segregation may propagate negative social environments
in multiple ways. Highly segregated cities suffer from
higher levels of violent and property crime (64–66). This
association seems particularly true for cities with high income inequality, poverty concentration, and segregation on
the isolation dimension, suggesting that social isolation and
corresponding economic inequality may be particularly important in this regard (65, 67, 68). Neighborhood health is
thereby worsened, not only by risk of victimization but also
by alterations to individual behavior and social networks
associated with living in a dangerous environment (69,
70). Finally, a combination of increased crime and systematic differences in policing and arrests results in high male
incarceration rates in many segregated black urban communities (71, 72). This large-scale incarceration of young black
men affects the health of the men but has also been implicated in destabilizing family support systems, thereby impacting the health of women and children (73, 74).
Both isolation and concentration probably enhance the
spread of infectious disease such as tuberculosis (75, 76),
human immunodeﬁciency virus (77), and gonorrhea (78)
and possibly lead to racially disparate exposure to environmental toxins. There is conﬂicting evidence on differential
toxic exposure, with 2 studies suggesting an increased
health risk for poor and minority communities from toxin
releases in highly segregated cities (79–81) but 1 study observing racial differences in exposure to toxic hazards that
were not explainable by degree of segregation (82).
Also of concern is differential access to local health-relevant
resources. Segregated and poor neighborhoods tend to have
fewer options for purchasing healthy food and more options
for purchasing alcohol (83–87). Simply residing in economically deprived neighborhoods may also be associated with
important health outcomes such as obesity and heart disease
(88–90). There is mixed evidence regarding whether Medicaid
Epidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

Is Segregation Unhealthy?

participation by physicians varies with degree of residential
segregation, with 2 studies suggesting it does (91, 92) but 2
others suggesting that the effect is small to none (93, 94).
Segregation and social capital

Social capital has been deﬁned as the degree of social
trust, extent of social networks, and willingness to provide
mutual aid and reciprocity between individuals in a given
area (95, 96). Kawachi (97) and others have proposed that
variations in social capital may explain geographic variations in population health, with a relative health-protective
effect of living in a social-capital-rich area. Although Putnam (95) suggests that increased social capital is associated
with increased equality, it has been argued that the social
capital in a given area does not necessarily cross race or
class lines and in some cases may be inversely associated
with indicators of racial equity (98).
Whether degree of metropolitan segregation increases or
decreases social capital is unclear. There is some evidence
that high-isolation segregation and concomitant poverty
concentration decrease black social capital and reduce interracial trust (99–101). However, a body of evidence also
suggests health-protective effects for blacks who live in
racially homogenous ethnic enclaves, a phenomenon attributed to enhanced social support and ties. For example, Bell
et al. (102) found that isolation segregation increases risk of
low-birth-weight infants but that, when conditioning on isolation, higher clustering segregation reduces risk of low
birth weight. It is posited that, given the adverse environment posed by isolation segregation, increased clustering
may provide social support and enhance political power
for black communities. Laveist (103, 104) suggests that
the black political empowerment that sometimes results
from high-clustering segregation can counter the negative
effects of segregation on health outcomes.
Segregation and individual behaviors and exposures

It is also plausible that some effect of segregation on
health could be mediated through individual-level behaviors
and exposures patterned by the socioeconomic and neighborhood environmental effects previously described. While
much research has looked at individual behaviors to understand racial disparities in health generally, relatively few
studies have considered individual behaviors as mediating
variables between segregation and health. Increasing residential segregation is associated with eating less fruit (105)
and being less physically active (106). For black women,
living in neighborhoods with either relatively low or relatively high segregation has been associated with increased
smoking during pregnancy (107). Black women typically
smoke less than whites during pregnancy (108), and the
authors attribute the increased smoking to inﬂuence of the
majority group in the integrated neighborhoods and response to stressors in the segregated neighborhoods.
A different category of individual exposure now receiving
increased attention is the role of psychosocial stress (109–
111)—including adverse life events and perceived racism
Epidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

183

(112)—in chronically ‘‘weathering’’ immune and neuroendocrine systems, thereby increasing susceptibility to disease
(113, 114). Whereas segregation can be seen as a form of
institutionalized racism (115), it may interact with personally mediated racism or discrimination, thus representing
a truly individual-level exposure. This hypothesis has perhaps been most widely tested in understanding determinants
of pregnancy outcomes, in which increased segregation and
perceived racism have been found to increase risk for black
women (102, 116, 117).
Reﬁning causal pathways through the lens of the
dimensions of segregation

Each of the 5 dimensions of segregation described by
Massey and Denton (5) serves as a proxy for overlapping,
but distinct types of residential patterning. To the degree that
the dimensions diverge, health researchers have an opportunity to test more reﬁned causal hypotheses for the effects
of segregation on health. Going hand in hand with this notion is the expectation that researchers clearly describe a hypothesized causal path by which the effects may be
mediated. Different health outcomes are sensitive to different mechanisms; thus, the dimension of segregation that is
most relevant is likely to vary by outcome of interest.
For example, Acevedo-Garcia (76) suggests that segregation on the concentration and isolation dimensions may be
conducive to the spread of infectious diseases, whereas
Dickerson (47) reports that clustering and evenness are most
predictive of the degree of black unemployment. Either unevenness or the contiguous clustering of predominantly
black neighborhoods could similarly associate with these
negative exposures; however, conditional on degree of isolation, they may represent the ethnic enclave effect, which
provides social support and increases relative political
power (103, 118). As previously discussed, this possibly
protective effect of one kind of segregation, conditioning
on others, suggests a richer complexity that can be leveraged
in hypothesizing causal pathways. One other pattern deserving of attention is the hypersegregated area, where segregation is deemed high on all 5 dimensions, possibly incurring
a unique health effect not seen in cities considered high
regarding only some dimensions (119, 120).
SEGREGATION-HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS

We identiﬁed 39 studies that used quantitative approaches
to measuring an association between racial segregation and
a health outcome (Table 1). The vast majority demonstrated
statistically signiﬁcant observed associations, although the
evidence for a causal association is limited by study designs.
Seventeen studies (most conducted before 2000) were crosssectional ecologic (1, 75, 78, 103, 112, 121–132), 16 studies
were cross-sectional multilevel (accounting for various
individual-level covariates while acknowledging segregation as an inherently contextual variable) (28, 29, 37, 69,
102, 120, 133–142), 5 utilized follow-up data collected
either prospectively or retrospectively (143–147), and 1 utilized a time-series, cross-sectional ecologic design (148). In
terms of health outcomes, the majority of the earlier studies

focused on infant and adult mortality, while studies of the
past decade broadened to include a wide variety of reproductive, infectious, and chronic disease endpoints.
A third of the studies conducted in the past decade relied
on racial composition of neighborhoods to deﬁne segregation rather than indices that place those neighborhood comEpidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

positions in the context of the wider city. As previously
noted, the proportion of blacks in a neighborhood is an incomplete description of residential patterns, although
several studies used custom-deﬁned thresholds of proportion black to describe ‘‘predominantly black’’ and
‘‘predominantly white’’ neighborhoods (37, 121, 123, 134,

188 Kramer and Hogue

135), which may coarsely serve as a proxy for citywide
segregation.
Of the remaining two-thirds of the studies, the dissimilarity index was the most common measure, although several studies also used the isolation index. Acevedo-Garcia
(36) suggests that health researchers have opted for the ease
of interpreting the dissimilarity index without appreciating
the conceptual complexities represented by differing measures. The dissimilarity index may be the conceptually
weakest in terms of understanding ill-health effects of segregation, whereas isolation and concentration may be stronger in patterning unhealthy environments and exposures. In
fact, it is segregation measured on the evenness scale that
sometimes appears to be health protective (102, 121, 123,
129), although, in most of these cases, it was evenness,
controlling for isolation, suggesting that the hypothesized
ethnic enclave effect is visible only after conditioning on
isolation.
Studies varied greatly in model speciﬁcations. Because
the hypothesized effect of segregation is mediated through
many socioeconomic and behavioral processes, distinguishing between a variable that confounds the association and
one that is a mediator is by no means simple. Increasingly,
studies of the past few years have explicitly stated the underlying conceptual model tested and have discussed conditioning and interacting effects of individual and
neighborhood variables with segregation (28, 29, 37, 69,
102, 107, 120, 130, 134–139, 141, 142, 149).
While there are important geographic variations in white
health outcomes, the spatial determinants of health appear to
be quite different for whites and blacks (126, 129). With few
exceptions (112, 123, 135, 145, 147), the sometimesprofound effects of segregation on black health outcomes
are absent for whites in the same cities. When a negative
association has been found, it is usually among poor whites
living in predominantly black neighborhoods.
ARE SEGREGATION-RELATED HEALTH EFFECTS
MODIFIABLE?

There is an intrinsic beneﬁt in better understanding pathways to population health, regardless of whether the pathways are easily modiﬁable. However, there is a more
pressing public health beneﬁt in focusing on exposures that
are at least potentially modiﬁable. Theoretically, residential
segregation is a modiﬁable exposure, yet effective instrumental attempts to reduce segregation in the United States
have yet to be developed.
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 is the only coordinated
policy initiative taken to reduce racial residential segregation, and its scope is arguably incomplete (150). There were
small, but steady declines in racial residential segregation
between 1970 and 2000 (40, 151), although one study noted
that black-white segregation declined at the micro level only
but that macro segregation has been unchanged (27). Despite possible improvements over 30 years, black Americans
remain the most segregated minority group in the United
States.
In terms of intervention research on housing or neighborhood choice and health or social outcomes, 2 studies are

frequently cited. The 1976 court decree establishing the
Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program in Chicago, Illinois,
was in response to a preceding housing discrimination lawsuit against the Chicago Housing Authority claiming systematic discrimination in public housing. The Gautreaux
program represents a natural experiment wherein 7,000
housing vouchers were made available to residents of highly
segregated Chicago neighborhoods with the requirement
that recipients be placed in racially integrated, low- to
moderate-poverty neighborhoods (152). Subsequent studies
of the placement cohort found that, 10–20 years later, the
majority continued to live in lower poverty, less-segregated
neighborhoods than prior to placement (153); secondgeneration boys placed in the suburbs had fewer drug
offenses (154); and, among males relocating to areas with
higher proportions of college graduates, all-cause and
homicide-related mortality was lower (155).
In the federally funded, randomized Moving To Opportunity (MTO) trial, public-housing-eligible families were
assigned either housing counseling with a voucher requiring
placement in a low-poverty neighborhood, a voucher without geographic restriction, or no voucher (156). While early
evidence supported positive economic effects for treatment
families (157), those gains may not persist with time (158,
159). In terms of health outcomes, there is some evidence
that families that moved to low-poverty neighborhoods experienced signiﬁcantly improved mental health (160) and
lower obesity rates (161), but other health outcomes such
as asthma and self-reported health were not different from
those of controls.
In separate reviews of housing-mobility programs and
health effects, Acevedo-Garcia et al. (162) and Anderson
et al. (45) suggest that there is modest support for rental
voucher programs as one approach to improve housing
safety, reduce risk of crime victimization, and improve
adult and child mental health. The paucity of evidence
for other outcomes is in large part due to the absence of
health outcomes as originally measured indicators in either
study.
Research that continues to pursue the effects of public
housing policy interventions on population health is important. Another approach is to view the causal chain from
segregation to health as a series of opportunities for intervention, with an overarching goal of increasing access to
‘‘opportunity neighborhoods’’ for all (39). This option
opens up opportunities to alter negative effects of segregation that could range from assisting in opening housing
markets so that moves out of concentrated poverty are
possible (45, 153, 162) to addressing characteristics of segregated neighborhoods that are unhealthy, as seen in the
built-environment literature (163, 164). One caution, however, is that researchers seeking to remedy the effects of
segregation remain cognizant of the distinction between the
process of segregation (e.g., institutionalized racism or inequitable access to health-promoting opportunities) and
the state or condition of segregation (living near black families or far from white families) (115). It is most probable that
any injurious attributes of segregation result from inequity
in the process rather than the condition of close proximity
to black families (or distance from white families) per se.
Epidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

Is Segregation Unhealthy?

DISCUSSION

The weight of the available evidence is that the process of
racial residential segregation is associated with generally
deleterious health of African Americans, and particularly
for poor pregnancy outcomes, but this evidence is limited
in many regards. Although segregation and social outcomes
have been studied for decades, analyzing segregation as
a useful construct in epidemiologic research is still in its
infancy. In 2003, Acevedo-Garcia et al. (36) reviewed the
state of residential segregation and health research, making
4 recommendations: develop multilevel research designs,
expand segregation research beyond black-white to include
other ethnic and racial groups, consider interaction between
racial and economic segregation, and further develop the
conceptual framework in which to understand segregation
and health. Much progress has been made in response to
these goals, but much work remains in order to understand
how to best measure segregation, understand mechanisms
by which distal social forces become proximal social and
biologic outcomes, and test amenable paths to intervention.
Future research should consider several issues.
First, continued development of methodological and conceptual tools to better understand residential segregation is
necessary. While many recent studies use multilevel thinking in both conceptual and statistical approaches, clarity is
still needed regarding the relevant scale of effect (e.g., of the
measured neighborhood), levels of interest, and mediating
variables. The interesting ﬁndings of variable segregation
effects across different dimensions such as clustering and
isolation should encourage researchers to further investigate
the multidimensional nature of residential patterns and
health. Similarly, use of newer spatial indices of segregation
as well as multigroup indices may provide more insight than
repetitive use of the US Census–derived dissimilarity index.
Although this review focuses primarily on racial residential
segregation, it is clear that poverty concentration and economic segregation are closely linked with racial settlement
patterns. Research considering the interaction of economic
and racial segregation is still needed.
Second, the existing segregation-health literature can be
decomposed into 2 broad categories: 1) segregation as an
exposure in intercity studies and 2) segregation as a local
exposure in intracity research. This distinction is extremely
important. The body of work using single cities to explore
the health effects of segregation is an extension of the
neighborhood-effects literature (46); it posits that the neighborhood context in mostly black neighborhoods is different
from that in mixed-race or predominantly white neighborhoods and therefore impacts health. This approach has the
strength of ﬁner spatial resolution of individuals nested
within neighborhoods, but Oakes (63) has argued that counterfactual reasoning in research on neighborhood effects and
health outcomes may suffer from unmeasured confounding
by forces that select individuals into neighborhoods. In other
words, individuals are not randomly assigned to neighborhoods within a city; thus, groups may not be exchangeable.
Intercity research, on the other hand, has tended to look
at the average health of residents of metropolitan areas
(although typically controlling for individual-level covariEpidemiol Rev 2009;31:178–194

189

ates such as age, gender, and risk behaviors) and uses the
heterogeneity of segregation across metropolitan areas to
make inferences about the impact of segregation net of
individual characteristics. This approach posits that living
in a city with higher segregation (e.g., greater exposure to
institutionalized racism) negatively impacts the health of
all black residents, regardless of the racial composition of
their neighborhood of residence. While this approach offers a partial solution to the selection problem (e.g., segregation may be one of the previously unmeasured forces
that differentially sort individuals), most such studies lose
the spatial resolution to know how outcomes varied by
neighborhood within metropolitan areas. Further extending the multilevel framework to include individuals nested
within neighborhoods nested within an ample number of
heterogeneous metropolitan areas could offer promising
new insight.
Finally, the segregation-health literature could be greatly
enhanced by utilizing longitudinal in addition to crosssectional study designs. Longitudinal designs could be applied to individuals, neighborhoods, or metropolitan areas,
each with different implications. Most of the pathways hypothesized between segregation and health act across the
life course, but there is almost no literature that accounts
for different levels of cumulative exposure across the life
course and very little literature with prospective information
on health outcomes. For some poor and minority individuals, living in highly segregated environments may not be
a time-varying exposure but rather a life-long constant
(38). However, there is evidence that intercity and intracity
migration varies by race and economics and with regard to
metropolitan segregation, suggesting that longitudinal comparisons could be meaningfully made between those living in
high- versus low-segregated cities (30). Alternatively, neighborhoods or metropolitan areas could be followed longitudinally to better understand the relation between residential
patterning and health. Such time-series approaches might be
particularly fruitful in areas characterized by progressive gentriﬁcation or decay over time. Similarly, time-series, crosssectional analysis of health patterns in cities across the decades
could document health changes associated with changing
segregation.
The vast majority of black Americans live in urban settings, many but not all of which are highly segregated. It is
vitally important to understand how much of their health
disparities are a result of speciﬁc dimensions of segregation
and whether these disparities can be reduced either by policies that reduce segregation or interventions that reduce the
impact of segregation.
