Absence of Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment in
Elderly Medicaid-Insured Nursing Home Residents
Cathy J. Bradley, Jan P. Clement, Chunchieh Lin

Background

Little is known about the effect cancer has on the lives of nursing home patients and the quality of care,
including palliative care, delivered to them.

Methods

Using a statewide population-based dataset assembled from the Michigan Tumor Registry and Medicare
records, we identified 1907 elderly Medicaid-insured nursing home residents who were diagnosed with
cancer between 1997 and 2000. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and
relative risks (RRs) according to age, race, sex, income, comorbidity, and cancer site for late or unstaged
cancer at diagnosis, death within 3 months of diagnosis, receipt of hospice care, and—for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer—the likelihood of cancer-directed surgery. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Nursing home residents diagnosed with cancer had a preponderance of late or unstaged disease (62%),
high mortality within 3 months of diagnosis (48%), and low hospice use if they had distant-stage cancer
(28%). Only 22% received cancer-directed surgery, 61% of which was confined to breast cancer patients,
and only 6% of patients received chemotherapy and/or radiation. Older age was positively associated with
late or unstaged cancer and with death within 3 months of diagnosis. Patients aged 71–75 years were
more likely to have cancer-directed surgery than patients aged 86 years and older (OR = 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 6.32; RR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.75). African American patients were less
likely to receive surgery (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.99; RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.03) than white
patients. Other demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions had little predictive value with
regard to cancer treatment or hospice use in nursing home patients.

Conclusions

Very few cancer services are provided to Medicaid-insured nursing home patients, despite the fact that
many of these patients likely experienced cancer-related symptoms and marked physical decline before
diagnosis and death. A middle ground between what would be considered guideline treatment practices
and the apparent absence of diagnosis and treatment is needed.
J Natl Cancer Inst 2008;100:21–31

The prevalence of cancer in nursing home patients is approximately
1 in 10 (1), but elderly nursing home patients have received little
attention in cancer outcomes research. Instead, most studies that
have addressed cancer diagnosis, treatment efficacy, guideline care,
survival, and even disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and
survival have focused on younger populations residing in the community (2–7). As the US population ages, more and more people
will become nursing home residents (8), many of whom will be
diagnosed with, and eventually die from, cancer (9,10). Little is
known about the effect cancer has on the lives of nursing home
patients and the quality of care, including palliative care, delivered
to them (11,12).
Late cancer stage at diagnosis and the absence of cancer treatment is associated with race and ethnicity (13–19), low socioeconomic status (20–22), and the presence of comorbid conditions
(23–25), including dementia and Alzheimer disease (26,27).
However, in elderly nursing home residents, these factors
may have less inﬂuence on cancer detection and treatment than
does life expectancy (28), the ability to withstand and beneﬁt from
jnci.oxfordjournals.org

treatment, and the presence of a patient advocate (eg, family
member).
Nationwide, Medicaid is the predominant payer for long-term
residential nursing home care, with approximately 36% of Medicaid
payments for nursing home care (29). Patients insured by both
Medicare and Medicaid (often referred to as dually eligible) have
very low incomes––73% have annual income below $10 000 compared with 12% of all other Medicare beneﬁciaries (30). These

Prior knowledge
The extent and quality of cancer care provided to nursing home
patients have not been carefully assessed.
Study design
Regression models based on federal (Medicaid and Medicare) and
state (Michigan Tumor Registry) databases were used to analyze
the frequency of cancer-related medical care among nursing home
residents according to age, race, and other variables.
Contribution
The study provides quantitative information needed to assess the
extent of cancer care delivered to nursing home residents.
Implications
A preponderance of late or unstaged disease, high mortality within
a few months of cancer diagnosis, and low rates of hospice use
and cancer treatment warrant the attention of the medical
community.
Limitations
Information on patient or family preferences for treatment was
not available and the study was restricted to Michigan Medicaid
patients and thus not representative of the entire nursing home
population.

patients tend to be the frailest of the frail elderly, and more than
30% of them require assistance to perform three or more activities
of daily living (31). Despite these residents’ need for care and its
potential beneﬁts, the ability of nursing homes to respond with
high-quality service is often lacking (32,33) and nursing home staff
may not recognize and treat cancer and/or its symptoms in the
residents.
We examined cancer care delivered to nursing home patients,
the vast majority of whom are adults aged 80 years or older.
Using a unique statewide population-based dataset, we assessed
four cancer care outcomes in Medicaid-insured nursing home
patients. The ﬁrst was stage of cancer at diagnosis (including prevalence of cancer for which the exact stage was not determined),
under the assumption that cancer stage is the single best indicator
of prognosis (34). Here, we examined not only the prevalence of
late-stage cancer but also the prevalence of cancers for which the
exact stage had not been determined. A diagnosis of late- or invasive but unknown-stage cancer inﬂuences the type and extent of
cancer treatment recommended and is an indication that early
detection techniques (ie, screening) may not have been employed
before disease symptoms. Although it is possible that some of the
cancers that are “unstaged” could be early-stage disease, the mortality following diagnosis suggests that these cancers are advanced.
Staging is predictive of treatment delivery because diagnostic tests
required for staging are generally performed in patients for whom
treatment is planned (34). The second outcome was death within
3 months of diagnosis. The third was receipt of hospice care, which
past studies have found to be surprisingly low (29%) in nursing
home cancer patients (1). Finally, assuming that some cancers will
be diagnosed at a stage at which surgery can provide extended survival and/or improved quality of life, we examined as a fourth outcome the likelihood of cancer-directed surgery. We limited the

analysis of this outcome to patients diagnosed with early-stage
breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer—sites for which surgery
has been shown to be efﬁcacious for early-stage disease. Using the
four outcomes, we sought to understand the patterns of care provided to nursing home cancer patients.

Subjects and Methods
Data
We used statewide Medicaid and Medicare data merged with the
Michigan Tumor Registry to extract a study sample of patients with
a first primary cancer diagnosis. External audit findings have found
that the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program, which maintains
the Michigan Tumor Registry, successfully abstracts greater than
95% of all cancer cases diagnosed in the state. This study was
approved by institutional review boards at the Michigan Department
of Community Health, Michigan State University, and Virginia
Commonwealth University.
Patients in the Tumor Registry were matched to the Michigan
state segment of the Medicare Denominator File for the years
1996 through 2000 using the patients’ Social Security numbers.
Vital status was available in the tumor registry for all patients
through December 2003. From the statewide Medicare ﬁles, we
extracted all claims for inpatient, outpatient, physician, and hospice services during the study period for all patients that correctly
matched to the Michigan state segment of the Medicare
Denominator File (approximately 89% of patients) and enrolled in
Medicare Parts A and B and in a fee-for-service plan. Medicare
Part A covers inpatient care in hospitals, short-term skilled nursing
facilities, and hospice care, whereas Part B covers medical services
like doctors’ visits, outpatient care, and other medical services.
Michigan proved to be an ideal state for merging cancer registry
and Medicare data because less than 3% of Michigan Medicare
beneﬁciaries were enrolled in managed care. Therefore, Medicare
claims were available for the vast majority of Medicare-insured
Michigan residents.
Medicaid-insured patients were identiﬁed by matching the
Medicaid eligibility ﬁles against the tumor registry, using either
deterministic or probabilistic methods. The total number of
incorrect matches produced by either method was approximately
1%, and the correct prediction rate of those identiﬁed as being
Medicaid insured was 93%. Nursing home residency was determined from the Medicaid monthly eligibility ﬁle and the Medicaid
nursing home claim ﬁle. To be considered nursing home residents,
patients had to have claims for nursing home services within
6 months before the month of diagnosis. Comparable nursing
home residency data were not available for Medicare beneﬁciaries
who were not also enrolled in Medicaid. The process for linking
the Tumor Registry, Medicare, and Medicaid datasets is described
more fully elsewhere (35).
To this linked tumor registry, Medicare, and Medicaid ﬁle,
we added data from the 1990 Census Summary File using patient
address information recorded in the tumor registry. The Census
Summary File provided information on median income that
households within a census tract earned, which is correlated with
cancer stage (36). We used the data from the 1990 census instead
of the 2000 census because we obtained a better match to patients

in our sample. For patients with data in both the 1990 and 2000
census ﬁles, their census tract characteristics (eg, income and education) were qualitatively similar.
Sample Selection
We limited the sample to nursing home residents diagnosed with
cancer between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2000, to have
at least 1 year of claims history before the month of diagnosis
with which to estimate patients’ comorbidity burden. A total of
1907 nursing residents were identified. Our sample included 142
patients who became eligible for Medicaid following the diagnosis
of cancer. We created a dichotomous variable to identify these
patients because their Medicaid enrollment was most likely spurred
by their cancer diagnosis. Therefore, they may be systematically
different from nursing home cancer patients who are insured by
Medicaid at the time of diagnosis.
Using logistic regressions that controlled for covariates, we
estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the following dependent
variables: late or invasive but unknown stage of cancer, death
within 3 months of diagnosis, receipt of hospice services, and
receipt of cancer-directed surgery.
Cancer stage was identiﬁed from the tumor registry. The
tumor registry records an invasive but unknown stage for
all patients with invasive disease but for whom a stage was not
identiﬁed. The tumor registry also records regional or distantstage disease, which is deﬁned according to the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage. Certain
cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and brain
cancer, are typically not staged. Therefore, we removed patients
with these cancers from the analysis of cancer stage.
Because nearly half of the patients in our sample died 3 months
following a cancer diagnosis (48%) and approximately 85% died by
December 2003, we chose death within 3 months following diagnosis as the second outcome.
Given the high mortality rate among patients in the nursing
home sample, we chose as a third outcome the use of hospice
services before death. The criterion for hospice use was one or
more claims for hospice services in the Medicare claim ﬁle. We
limited the sample to patients with distant or invasive but
unknown-stage cancer because they are least likely to beneﬁt from
treatment with curative intent, have short life expectancies, and
are, therefore, optimal candidates for hospice care.
The fourth outcome was the prevalence of cancer-directed
treatment. Cancer-directed treatments were deﬁned as surgery,
chemotherapy, or radiation. We examined these treatments and
found that the vast majority of nursing home patients (93%) did
not receive chemotherapy or radiation. Therefore, in a multivariable analysis, we assessed the likelihood of cancer-directed surgery
only and not other forms of treatment. For this analysis, we limited
the sample to patients diagnosed with cancer at the most common
sites—breast, colon/rectum, lung, and prostate–who had in situ,
local, or regional-stage disease. Surgery can alleviate symptoms
and possibly extend life for patients with these cancer sites and
stages. The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD), Current
Procedural Terminology, Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System
(HCPCS) codes used to identify cancer treatments are given in the
appendix.
jnci.oxfordjournals.org

Statistical Analysis
We controlled for patient characteristics and census tract income.
Patient characteristics included age (66–70, 71–75, 76–80, 81–85,
and ≥86 years), race (white and African American or other), sex, and
comorbidity. To estimate patient comorbidity burden, we used the
Deyo et al. (37) and Klabunde et al. (38) adaptation of the Charlson
Comorbidity Index (39), which has been used to explain the probability and extent of cancer treatment (38). However, in elderly cancer patients, the Charlson Comorbidity score does not adequately
reflect functional ability or predict tolerance to treatment (40,41).
We identified patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease or dementia using the following ICD-9 codes: 331.0 (Alzheimer disease)
(26,27); 331.x (frontotemporal dementia, senile degeneration of the
brain, hydrocephalus [communicating and obstructive], and cerebral degeneration); 290.0 (dementias and senile psychotic conditions); and 797 (senility without mention of psychosis).
Variables for census tract income were obtained from the
1990 Census Summary File. The income categories (in dollars)
were: ≤25 000, 25 001–35 000, 35 001–45 000, and &gt;45 000. We
also created a variable to indicate missing income information.
Income information was considered to be missing if the patient’s
address was either absent or incorrectly coded in the dataset.
Census tract income was missing for fewer than 9% of the
patients.
All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.1. The statistical signiﬁcance of the association of the independent variables
with the dependent variable was assessed with the chi-square likelihood ratio test. Adjusted odds ratios and relative risks (RRs) and
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated for equations that
predicted the likelihood of late or unstaged cancer, death within
3 months following diagnosis, hospice use, and cancer-directed
surgery. The odds ratios and relative risks were qualitatively similar. Therefore, we focus the discussion on the odds ratios but
report relative risks in the tables. All reported P values correspond
to two-sided tests. The threshold for statistical signiﬁcance was
set at an alpha level of .05. To put the distribution of cancer stage
at diagnosis for nursing home residents in perspective, we compared their distribution of cancer stage at diagnosis with the cancer
stage distribution in Michigan dual eligible community residents
and Medicare-only beneﬁciaries diagnosed during the same time
period.

Results
A little more than one-third of the patients were aged 86 years or
older (Table 1). The majority of the patients were white, were
female, resided in census tracts with household incomes less than
$35 000, and had one or more comorbid conditions. Approximately
one-fourth of the patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease
and/or dementia.
Cancers were most prevalent at the following sites: breast
(14%), colon/rectum (17%), lung (15%), and prostate (10%). The
majority (62%) of cancers were diagnosed with a SEER summary
stage of distant or invasive but unknown. Invasive but unknownstage disease accounted for 43% of all cancer diagnoses. Given the
prevalence of unstaged cancers, one might have expected a higher
proportion in the sample of leukemia or other hematologic cancers

before diagnosis. Patients who enrolled in Medicaid after diagnosis
survived an average of 18 months, compared with 8 months for
those enrolled in Medicaid before diagnosis. Patients that enrolled
in Medicaid following diagnosis, by deﬁnition, had to survive long
enough to be enrolled in Medicaid, that is, 3 months or more following diagnosis.
We compared the stage at diagnosis among nursing home residents with other Michigan community dual-eligible beneﬁciaries
and Medicare-only beneﬁciaries who were also diagnosed with
cancer during the same time period (Fig. 1). Relative to other

elderly residents, a much larger proportion of nursing home residents had unstaged cancers and few had in situ or local-stage cancers. Nursing home residency is unknown in the Medicare-only
beneﬁciaries included in Fig. 1, and nursing home residents in the
Medicare sample would tend to diminish the differences between
this group and Medicaid nursing home residents.
There were no differences in the receipt of treatment or
hospice use by Medicaid enrollment category. Therefore, we
report the number and percentages for the full sample, excluding
those patients without any medical claims (Table 2).
Only 7% of all patients received chemotherapy and/or radiation.
Among patients with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer,
22% received cancer-directed surgery. Patients with local-stage
disease were most likely to have surgery. The majority of surgeries
(61%) were performed on women with breast cancer; surgeries
were performed to a much lesser extent (23%) on patients with
colorectal cancer. Only 28% of all patients received hospice care.
We calculated the odds ratios, relative risks, and 95% conﬁdence intervals for late or invasive but unknown cancer stage,
death within 3 months following diagnosis, and receipt of hospice
service according to age, race, sex, census tract income, comorbidity score, Alzheimer disease, and cancer site and stage (Table 3).
Relative to patients aged 86 years and older, patients aged
76–80 years and patients aged 81–85 years were less likely to be
diagnosed with late or unstaged cancer at diagnosis (OR = 0.57,
95% CI = 0.41 to 0.79, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.84,
respectively). Relative to women with breast cancer, patients with
colorectal (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.37), lung (OR = 5.25,
95% CI = 3.28 to 8.39), prostate (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.03 to
2.77), and other (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.72 to 3.44) cancers were
more likely to be diagnosed with late or unstaged cancer. In contrast, patients with urinary bladder cancer were much less likely to
have their cancer diagnosed at late stage than were women with

breast cancer (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.46). Thus, age and
cancer site were statistically signiﬁcantly associated with late or
unstaged cancer.
All patients younger than 81 years were less likely to die within
3 months of diagnosis than those aged 81 years or older (P &lt; .05).
Alzheimer disease was positively associated with death within
3 months following diagnosis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.70).
Patients with colorectal, lung, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal
cancers and patients diagnosed with leukemia or cancer at other
sites were more likely to die within 3 months of diagnosis than
were women with breast cancer. Patients with regional, distant, or
invasive but unknown-stage disease were more likely to die within
3 months of diagnosis than were patients with in situ or local-stage
cancer (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.51; OR = 6.06, 95% CI =
4.20 to 8.77; and OR = 9.12, 95% CI = 6.76 to 12.3,
respectively).

Because 48% of the patients died within 3 months of diagnosis, hospice care may have been appropriate for many of the
patients in our sample. To examine hospice use among the most
likely patient candidates, we limited the analysis to patients with
distant or invasive, but unknown-stage cancer because these
patients are not treated with intent to cure. A consistent predictive relationship between hospice use and variables for patient
age, comorbidity, Medicaid eligibility, and census tract income
was not observed. However, African American/other than white
race was positively associated with hospice use (OR = 1.57, 95%
CI = 1.16 to 2.13).

We calculated the likelihood of cancer-directed surgery for
patients diagnosed with in situ, local, or regional-stage breast,
colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer (Table 4). Patients aged
71–75 years were more likely to have cancer-directed surgery than
patients aged 86 years and older (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.26 to 6.32;
RR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.75). The odds ratio for patients aged
66–70 years was also greater than 1 and approached statistical signiﬁcance (OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 0.96 to 8.54). African Americans/races
other than white were less likely to receive cancer-directed surgery
than whites (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.99), although race was
not statistically signiﬁcant in the relative risk estimations (RR = 0.80,
95% CI = 0.62 to 1.03). Patients with colorectal, lung, or prostate
cancer were considerably less likely to receive cancer-directed surgery than were women with breast cancer.

This study reports patterns of cancer diagnosis, survival, hospice
use, and treatment for a population-based sample of Medicaidinsured nursing home patients. These nursing home patients had a
preponderance of late or unstaged disease, high mortality within
only a few months of diagnosis, low hospice use, and very little
cancer-directed treatment—even among patients with early-stage
cancer where treatment can alleviate symptoms (eg, bleeding and
discomfort associated with colon cancer) and possibly extend life.
Older age was positively associated with late-stage diagnosis and
death within 3 months of diagnosis and negatively associated with
cancer-directed surgery. African American/other race was positively associated with hospice use. Unlike what has been observed
in studies that were not specific to nursing home patients (2–7),
demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions were not
associated with cancer detection, treatment, survival, or hospice use
in nursing home residents.
Late and unstaged cancer was far more prevalent in nursing
home patients than in other elderly patients residing in
Michigan. This ﬁnding may be explained in part by the clinical
characteristics of the nursing home patients. A study of screening mammography in frail elderly women found that they were
more likely to be harmed (eg, unnecessary biopsy, emotional
stress) than helped by breast cancer screening (28). Other factors speciﬁc to nursing homes may contribute to late staging. A
survey of Directors of Nursing in 41 nursing homes in the
Midwest found that the majority of facilities lacked policies
regarding breast and prostate cancer screening (10). This lack
of policy guidelines may reﬂect the questionable beneﬁts and
potential harm associated with screening elderly patients. It is
also possible that nursing homes are challenged in their ability
to provide day-to-day care. Therefore, cancer-related services
may receive a low priority. Whatever the reason for the low
rates of screening and staging, the apparent practice of ignoring
cancer in nursing home patients is not likely to be in their best
interests. If cancer is not adequately diagnosed, it may not be
recognized as the source of pain or discomfort expressed by
nursing home patients. As a result, its symptoms may not be
treated appropriately.
Almost half of the cancer patients in our sample died within
3 months of diagnosis. In nearly all cases, cancer was noted as the

underlying cause of death. Such a high short-term mortality rate,
which could reﬂect late stage at diagnosis or the absence of treatment, would be considered to be unacceptable in other patient
populations. Furthermore, accompanying the high mortality rate
was a low rate of hospice use. In other studies, hospice use has been
associated with appropriate pain management (1) and increased
satisfaction with end-of-life care (42).
Only a fraction of patients with early-stage breast, colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer received cancer-directed surgery,
and it was primarily given to women with breast cancer.
Consistent with other studies of elderly African American cancer patients (43–45), people of African American/nonwhite race
in general were less likely to receive surgery than were white
patients, but the reason (whether quality of care, patient preference, or comorbid conditions) for this difference is unknown.
Although the majority of patients were not treated with intent
to cure, patients’ clinical and social circumstances may have
been such that invasive treatments would have been not only
futile but also detrimental.
This study has several limitations. First, it was speciﬁc to
Michigan and, as such, may not be applicable to other states or
regions. However, identiﬁcation of Medicaid-insured nursing
home patients, their cancer attributes (site, stage, date of diagnosis), and complete treatment information can only be done at the
state level. Second, had we been able to identify private-pay nursing homes patients, we may have observed differences in diagnosis,
mortality, and treatment patterns by payer type. Although such an
analysis may have been informative, the differences according to
payer type may be driven more by selection into a payer group
(Medicaid vs private payer) than the characteristics of the payer
(eg, low reimbursement rates). In other words, to qualify for
Medicaid, patients have to be medically needy. Medically needy
patients have very low incomes (often below $10 000 per year),
may have few assets and experience social conditions (eg, low educational attainment) that are correlated with poor health. These
conditions, rather than Medicaid reimbursement, may account for
the type of care received. Although our ﬁndings are speciﬁc to
Medicaid patients, this population accounts for approximately half
of all nursing home patients (46).
Third, we did not have information on patient and family preferences for treatment or caregiver availability. Studies suggest that
the preferences of cancer patients’ and/or their physicians’ for
treatment vary by patient age (9) with preferences leaning toward
less aggressive or palliative care for older adults. Information on
the presence of a caregiver who could act as a patient advocate may
have offered insight into the preferences of the family and their
ability to assist the cancer patient.
Fourth, this study did not take into account organizational
characteristics such as availability of services, size, and practice patterns that are predictive of nursing home quality and hospice use
(47). Finally, care patterns may have changed since the study time
period (1997–2000). However, such changes are unlikely because
payment and stafﬁng resources for nursing home care have not
become more plentiful in the last decade, and although there have
been efforts to improve quality of care in nursing homes, these
efforts address basic day-to-day care such as preventing pressure
ulcers (48).

From these observational data, we cannot draw deﬁnitive conclusions about the quality of cancer care delivered to nursing home
patients. Nevertheless, our study suggests that very few cancer
services in the area of detection, treatment, and hospice care are
provided to Medicaid-insured nursing home patients even though
many of these patients would have experienced cancer-related
symptoms (eg, pain, obstruction, fatigue, and weight loss) and
marked physical decline before diagnosis and death (49). Further
investigation is needed to establish guidelines for cancer-related
care, including cancer detection, for frail elderly patients. Control
of pain symptoms, in particular, has been shown to be inadequate
among nursing home cancer patients (1) and should be the focus
of future investigations. As part of the establishment of guidelines
for elderly patients, the economic and social implications of change
in clinical practice need to be investigated.
Finally, one interpretation of our ﬁndings might be that nursing home patients with cancer are “better off” because cancer,
unlike some other diseases, appears to quickly end lives that may
be plagued by considerable suffering. This opinion should be
viewed in the context of society’s continual struggle with when to
end patients’ medical treatments and the viewpoint that nursing
homes serve patients awaiting death. However, the absence of
treatment may not reduce suffering. Nursing homes, unlike hospices, are not designed to cater exclusively to the dying. Also,
unlike hospices, nursing homes provide care for patients with
chronic conditions other than cancer (eg, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes). Yet, cancer appears to be ignored, suggesting that guidelines for the recognition and treatment of cancer in frail elderly
patients are needed and should be communicated to health care
professionals, patients, and caregivers. An aging population, coupled with trends in cancer diagnosis and treatment, will shift more
cancer care (particularly the care of second primary cancers) to
nursing homes and make investigations into the care of nursing
home cancer patients particularly relevant. At present, nursing
homes may be unequipped to recognize and care for their residents
with cancer.
