Functional and Morphological Evidence of Age-Related
Denervation in Rat Laryngeal Muscles
Colleen A. McMullen and Francisco H. Andrade
Department of Physiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington.
Laryngeal muscle dysfunction compromises voice, swallowing, and airway protection in elderly adults. Laryngeal muscles and their motor neurons and their motor neurons communicate via the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We tested the
hypothesis that aging disrupts NMJ organization and function in the laryngeal thyroarytenoid (TA) and posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscles We determined NMJ density and size and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit mRNAs in
TA and PCA muscles from 6-, 18-, and 30- month old-rats. NMJ function was determined with tubocurarine (TC) and
contractions during nerve and muscle stimulation. NMJ size, abundance, and clustering decreased in 30-month TA and
PCA muscles. AChRe mTNA and protein increased with age in both muscles. AChRg mRNA increased with age in
both muscles while protein content increased in TA only. Aging PCA and TA were more sensitive to TC, demonstrating
functional evidence of denervation. These results demonstrate that NMJs become smaller and less abundant in aging TA
and PCA muscles.
Key Words: Larynx—Aging—Neuromuscular junction.

T

HE larynx is the gateway to the lungs. It plays a key
role in phonation, ventilation, swallowing, straining,
and airway protective reﬂexes. In the elderly population, atrophy of the larynx compromises voice quality and impairs
the ability to communicate and remain socially engaged.
Laryngeal dysfunction may also cause dysphagia and increased risk of aspiration, which are important causes of
morbidity and mortality in the elderly population.
Two groups of skeletal muscles move the larynx. The
extrinsic muscles move the whole larynx and change its position on the neck. The small intrinsic muscles, very specialized
skeletal muscles, control the size and the shape of the laryngeal inlet and the tension of the vocal folds. The biomechanics of the larynx are complex but most of the intrinsic
muscles can be classiﬁed as adductors because they appose
the vocal folds and close the glottis. Two muscles, the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA; the primary vocal fold abductor)
and the thyroarytenoid (TA; a vocal fold adductor), were
selected for this study due to their opposing activity. The
selection of these two muscles allowed us to determine how
laryngeal muscles with different functional roles change as
age increases. The paired TA muscles rotate the arytenoid
cartilages medially to approximate the vocal folds. These
muscles also control bulking, shortening, and tensing of the
vocal folds. The paired PCA muscles increase the transverse
dimension of the glottis and are important in maintaining
low resistance during times of increased ventilation because
the vocal folds act passively to obstruct airﬂow.
Other investigators have found signs of denervation and
reinervation in aged laryngeal muscles, including smaller
end plates and increased variability in end plate architecture
(1). Because of their strategic role for ventilation, swallowing, and airway protection, it is likely that even small de-

fects in laryngeal muscle function may translate to higher
mortality and morbidity. For example, age-related loss of
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) architecture is a likely cause
of laryngeal muscle dysfunction. A few studies have reported on the anatomy of motor units in the vocal muscles
of mammals other than human, whereas others have analyzed the distribution of the motor innervation of the rat larynx; however, these studies did not focus on aging (2–4).
The present study examined the effects of aging on the NMJ
structure and function in rat laryngeal muscles. We hypothesized that aging disrupts the organization and stability of
the NMJs leading to functional denervation in the rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles.
Materials and Methods

Animals
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky. Male
Fischer 344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats (6, 18, and
30 months of age) were obtained from the National Institute
on Aging Aged Rodent Colony: We used 8 rats per age for
histology and immunocytochemistry, 8 rats per age for
functional studies, 4 rats per age for electron microscopy,
and 18 rats per age for gene expression analysis. The age
groups were selected to represent three points in the life
span curve of this strain: 6 months (early ﬂat portion of low
mortality), 18 months (initial increase in mortality), and 30
months (linear decrease of survival curve) (5). Upon arrival,
the animals were kept in microisolator cages with Harlan
Teklad rodent food and water provided ad libitum. Prior to
the collection of tissues, the rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride or xylazine hydrochloride (100 mg/8

mg per kg body weight injected i.p.) and killed by exsanguination following a medial thoracotomy.
Histology
Whole larynges were dissected, covered with optimal
cutting temperature embedding medium, and frozen in 2methylbutane cooled to its freezing point in liquid nitrogen.
Ten-micron-thick frozen coronal and transversal sections
were used to examine TA and PCA muscles, respectively.
Sections were collected serially so that the middle sections
on each slide would correspond to the midsection of each
laryngeal muscle. NMJs were decorated with ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate–labeled a-bungarotoxin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and phalloidin (Invitrogen) as a control using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Sections were imaged
with a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a Spot RT
Slider camera and Spot RT software (v 4.0) and with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. Data for NMJ
quantity were collected using the Nikon E600 microscope,
whereas data for NMJ end plate size were collected with a
Leica confocal microscope. We analyzed 210 sections per
age from PCA and 160 sections per age from TA muscles.
The observers (J.B., T.N.) were blind to the experimental
condition of the rats. NMJ end plate size was measured
using NIH ImageJ software (6) by analyzing the circumference of the total end plate region. Twenty percent of
histological images used were randomly selected and examined by two raters. Interrater reliability was assessed
using the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (two-way, mixedmodel, single measure). Results demonstrated a high degree of agreement between raters (intraclass correlation
coefﬁcient = .978).
Electron Microscopy
Anesthetized rats were perfused with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), followed by 2% paraformaldehyde and 4%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and 130
mM NaCl. PCA and TA muscles were dissected, postﬁxed
in 1% osmium tetroxide, stained in uranyl acetate, dehydrated in methanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in

epoxy resin. Thin (70 nm) sections were stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate, and photographed with a Philips
Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope.
Acetylcholine Receptor Subunit Gene Expression
Total RNA was isolated from PCA and TA muscles
with nucleic acid puriﬁcation lysis solution (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol with the ABI Prism® 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation. Muscles from six animals were pooled to obtain
sufﬁcient tissue mass for each RNA sample. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II RNaseHReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamers.
Message abundance for the acetylcholine receptor (AChR)
subunits was measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Primers for the messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) of interest were designed using the software
package Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) from
GenBank nucleotide sequences (Table 1). Complementary
DNA samples (2 mg each) were analyzed in triplicate with
the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System using
SYBR Green. b-Actin was used as the calibrator housekeeping gene. The relative abundance of target mRNAs
was determined with the comparative cycle threshold
method (7,8).
Immunoblotting
Tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing
26 mM Tris–HCl, 0.3 M sucrose, 30 mM dithiothreitol, and
1% Triton X-100; pH was adjusted to 8.0. Protein samples
(50 mg per lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride microporus membranes. Membranes
were blocked and incubated with the primary antibody to
subunits AChRe and AChRg (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After washing the membranes with PBS and 0.1% Tween, they
were incubated for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor 680–conjugated
goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:7,500;
Invitrogen) and then washed again with PBS and 0.1%
Tween. Membranes were ﬁnally rinsed with PBS and

scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Density of resulting bands was
quantiﬁed using NIH ImageJ software (6).
Contractile Function
To study function in vitro, TA and PCA muscles were
dissected intact including cartilage fragments at the origin
and insertion. The isolated muscles were placed in a tissue
bath with platinum ﬁeld electrodes and ﬁlled with a physiological salt solution: (in mM) 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl2,
1.0 MgSO4, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 24 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose,
bubbled with 95% O2–5% CO2 to maintain pH at 7.4°C at
25°C. The muscles were ﬁrmly attached to a force transducer (AE801; SensoNor, Horten, Norway) and the arm of
a servomotor (Aurora Scientiﬁc Inc., Aurora, Canada) and
stretched to the length giving maximum force in response to
electrical stimulation (optimal length, L0). Force signals
(newtons) were sampled on line and normalized to muscle

cross-sectional area (cm2). We used the sensitivity to the
neuromuscular blocker tubocurarine (TC) to estimate the
degree of functional denervation in the aging laryngeal
muscles (9). Brieﬂy, TC concentration in the bathing medium was increased stepwise while we measured the ratio
of force in response to nerve stimulation (0.2 msecond pulse
duration) to force in response to direct muscle stimulation
(0.5 msecond pulse duration). As TC concentration increases, the effectiveness of nerve stimulation decreases as
a result of the neuromuscular transmission block. Functional denervation is then detected as enhanced sensitivity
to TC and a faster decline in the nerve stimulation over direct muscle stimulation ratio (9).

Quantitative results are presented as means and standard
error of the mean (SEM). Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by analysis of variance; post-hoc multiple comparisons

Results

End Plate Size Decreased in the Aging Intrinsic
Laryngeal Muscles
NMJ end plate density signiﬁcantly decreased with age in
both PCA and TA muscles from 6 to 30 months (Figure 1A).
NMJ size decreased signiﬁcantly in PCA at 30 months of
age compared with 6 months (Figure 1B, left). There was no
difference at 18 months. In TA muscles, NMJ size decreased
signiﬁcantly at both 18 and 30 months compared with 6
months (Figure 1B, right). NMJ quantity also decreased
with age. In PCA muscles, there were signiﬁcantly less
NMJs at 18 and 30 months compared with 6 months
(6 months 8.1 ± 1.9, 18 months 4.3 ± 2.8, 30 months 5.0 ± 2.9
per ﬁeld). In TA muscles, NMJs at 18 months were signiﬁcantly decreased compared with 6 months of age (p ≤ .05),
whereas at 30 months the decrease was not statistically signiﬁcant (p ≤ .05) (6 months 5.2 ± 2.7, 18 months 2.3 ± 1.5,
30 months 4 ± 2.4 per ﬁeld). Aging decreased clustering of
NMJs in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Clusters were deﬁned as three or more NMJs located no more than 5 mm
apart (Figure 2B). Clustering signiﬁcantly decreased with
age in both muscles (p = .01) (Figure 2B). Normal axons
and terminals were easily identiﬁed at 6 months of age in
TA muscles, whereas at 30 months there was greater receptor dispersion. The NMJs of the PCA muscles also showed
a less elaborate organization with age (Figure 2A). Receptor

clusters examined with electron microscopy showed an increased proportion of NMJs that are unoccupied by axon
terminals (see Figure 3). This recapitulates previous ﬁndings in rat TA muscle (1) and demonstrates the same phenomenon in PCA muscle.
Age Alters AChR Subunit Expression in the Laryngeal
Muscles
The decrease in end plate size and quantity of the NMJs
with age may reﬂect the changed expression of genes normally associated with AChR subunits. We compared transcript levels of the AChR subunits (a, b, e, g, and d) in PCA
and TA. mRNA content of the AChR subunits did indeed
change with age. In PCA muscles, there were increases of
mRNA for AChRa, -g, and -d subunits at 30 months compared with 6 months (Figure 4). In TA muscles, mRNA content of the AChRe and -g subunits increased at 30 months
versus 6 months, whereas expression of AChRd decreased
with age (Figure 5). Protein content determined by western
blot increased in TA for both AChRg and -e subunits with
age (Figure 5). In PCA muscles, protein content of AChRe
increased with age, whereas AChRg decreased (Figure 4).
Aging Laryngeal Muscles Are Weaker and More
Sensitive to TA
We measured the contractile properties of rat laryngeal
muscles in vitro to determine whether age inﬂuences their
function. The maximal tetanic force (P0) that PCA and TA
muscles can generate decreased about 15% by 30 months of
age (right vertical axes, Figures 6 and 7). Then, we used the

neuromuscular blocker TC to determine the degree of functional denervation in aging laryngeal muscles: A more signiﬁcant decrease in force produced in response to nerve
stimulation at any TC concentration indicates greater TC
sensitivity and, in consequence, is evidence of functional
denervation. For both laryngeal muscles at all ages, the ratio
of force in response to nerve stimulation to force during direct muscle stimulation (NS/MS) decreased as TC concentration increased in the bathing medium until neuromuscular
transmission was completely abolished and NS/MS became
0 (left vertical axis, Figures 6 and 7). For 6-month-old rats,
the NS/MS of PCA muscles remained greater than 0 up to
5 mM TC, and it was 0 at 10 and 20 mM. In contrast, the
decrease in NS/MS in PCA muscles from 30-month-old rats
was signiﬁcantly greater than at 6 months starting at the
lowest concentration used (0.5 mM), and NS/MS became
less than 10% at 1 mM and about 0 at 2 mM TC (Figure 6).
The response to TC was similar in the TA muscles. At
6 months of age, these muscles sustained NS/MS greater than
0 up to 5 mM TC. Similarly, the TA muscles from 30-monthold rats were more sensitive to TC and their NS/MS decreased
signiﬁcantly more even at the lowest concentrations, becoming less than 10% at 2 mM and 0 at 5 mM (Figure 7).

Discussion
We found evidence of decreased NMJ density in aging rat
laryngeal muscles. The decrease in NMJ abundance demonstrates loss of morphologically deﬁned innervation points in
PCA and TA muscles from 30-month-old rats. This loss of
end plate size and number could reﬂect loss of AChR density or changes due to the denervation of aging. Age also
changed the NMJ ultrastructure: Greater NMJ complexity
was seen at 6 months compared with 30 months. The motor
activity of the larynx is complex: Even reﬂex-like behavior
such as swallowing may depend on high-level inputs (12).
Perhaps not surprisingly, it appears that age affects laryngeal function to a greater extent than ventilatory function
(13). Gross laryngeal atrophy is a common ﬁnding in the
elderly population and is a likely cause of idiopathic voice
and swallowing alterations in older patients (14–16). There
is also a preferential age-related loss of type I ﬁbers in human laryngeal muscles, not the typical type II ﬁber loss seen
in aging limb skeletal muscles (17). Due to the paucity of
nondiseased human samples and small size of the laryngeal
muscles in rodents (the most commonly used animal models), few studies to date have explored the normal structure
and function of the laryngeal NMJ (1,10). These reports

have mostly focused on NMJ structure; scant attention has
been paid to its molecular underpinnings. There is strong
clinical evidence of laryngeal dysfunction in the old, but
only a handful of studies have reported mostly morphological changes consistent with denervation and reinnervation
in aged laryngeal muscles, including distal axonal degeneration, smaller end plates, and increased variability in end
plate architecture (1,18). Connor and associates (1) demonstrated that axon terminals and AChR vesicular clusters
decrease in TA muscles from old rats.
The safety factor for neuromuscular transmission on the
postsynaptic end plate depends on the density and subunit
composition of AChRs, junctional fold morphology, and
density of voltage-gated ion channels (19). Aging alters
AChRs subunit expression and decreases end plate size and
number in both PCA and TA muscles. This change is not
due to alterations in ﬁber size with age as these muscles
change differentially with aging: TA ﬁber size decreases

(20) with age, whereas PCA ﬁber size increases (data not
shown). The relation between end plate size and ﬁber diameter ensures effective transmission. Size matching would
then be impaired in the PCA muscles due to the increase in
ﬁber diameter.
Loss of normal AChR subunit stoichiometry may alter
normal NMJ structure and function. The g to e switch is exceptional because the remaining subunits do not require substitution and remain through out fetal and adult life. Age
preferentially changed AChRe and AChRg mRNA and protein levels. The expression of the adult subunit is initiated by
the myonuclei in the vicinity of the end plate, in response to
neuronal activation (21). AChRe knockout mice show delays in ﬁber-type transitions and reduction in motor activity
(22). The selective upregulation of the AChRg subunit follows axonal injury and age-related denervation in other skeletal muscles (23). Increased ACHRg usually correlates with
a loss of junctional folds; this may reﬂect an age-related

Figure 6. PCA muscles from older rats are weaker and more sensitive to
TC. Maximal tetanic force produced by PCA muscles (newtons/cm2, right vertical axis) was less at 30 months compared with 6 months (■ and □, respectively, **p &lt; .05 vs 6 months). The ratio of force produced in response to nerve
stimulation to force resulting from direct muscle stimulation (NS/MS, left vertical axis) in PCA muscles from 6- and 30-month-old rats (∆ and ▼, respectively). For 6-month PCA muscles, NS/MS decreased monotonically as TC
concentration increased; neuromuscular blockade was effectively 100% with 5
mm TC. PCA muscles from 30-month-old rats were more sensitive to TC: The
decrease in NS/MS decreased more at lower concentrations, reaching almost
100% block by 2 mM (*p &lt; .05 vs 6 months). PCA = posterior cricoarytenoid;
TC = tubocurarine.

Figure 7. TA muscles from older rats are weaker and more sensitive to TC.
Maximal tetanic force produced by TA muscles (newtons/cm2, right vertical

decrease in rapsyn (24). This ﬁnding is also characteristic of
aging skeletal muscles and AChRe knockout (24–26). The
difference between mRNA expression and protein content
in PCA muscles reﬂects a discrepancy in transcription to
translation. The remaining subunit mRNAs were also altered by age. Mutations in these subunits, although less frequent than e and d mutations, also lead to dysfunctional
neuromuscular signal transduction (27). AChRd changed
with age in both muscles; this subunit is thought to maintain
subunit communication that is critical for channel gating
(28). AChRa mRNA also changed with age in both muscles. This is the muscle subunit whose mutations initiate an
increased synaptic delay time, leading to extended postsynaptic activity (29). The complex process of NMJ function
also requires many other proteins such as agrin (involved in
NMJ clustering) and rapsyn (implicated in AChR assembly). It is unclear at this time if signaling function of these
and other proteins is sustained in the aging PCA and TA
muscles.
PCA and TA muscles from 30-month-old rats were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to TC: Their NS/MS decreased
more and complete neuromuscular block was achieved at
lower TC concentrations than in muscles from 6-month-old
rats. These results are consistent with less effective neuromuscular transmission in the laryngeal muscles from 30month-old rats and are evidence of functional denervation.
In other words, neuromuscular transmission is more likely to
fail in the laryngeal muscles from older rats under the described experimental conditions. Although greater sensitivity to TC per se does not localize the site(s) of neuromuscular

transmission failure, it ﬁts with the observed decrease in
neuromuscular junction abundance and smaller end plate
size (Figures 1 and 2) and supports the conclusion that the
safety factor for neuromuscular transmission is compromised in old laryngeal muscles. We also found that the PCA
and TA muscles from old rats are weaker (lower maximal
tetanic forces), extending previous results (20). It should be
noted that Gambino and associates (17) found that age had
no effect on the NMJs of human PCA muscles. In contrast,
NMJ end plate size decreases with age in rat TA muscle (1).
This may point to differences between the two laryngeal
muscles also demonstrated in this study. In addition, the results obtained by Gambino and associates may be confounded by small sample size and the “blurring” of the age
groups, leading to underestimation of potential age effects.
Laryngeal muscle weakness would worsen the effects of
functional denervation as faster motor neuron ﬁring frequency and greater motor unit recruitment would be needed
to achieve the required force. A subject might perceive these
conditions as greater effort, although the connection between motor unit activity or recruitment and the subjective
sensation of mechanical effort is not yet clear. A report by
Neto and Marques (30) showed no motor neuron loss within
the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. The authors concluded that
there is a functional defect at the NMJ. This study supports
our conclusion that it is the NMJ itself changing in aging
laryngeal muscles.
Present results demonstrate that aging disrupts NMJ organization and impairs neuromuscular transmission in the
PCA and TA muscles. Most notable is the decrease in NMJs

with age, which is in the opposite direction than aging hind
limb muscles (25). The lack of mechanistic studies to date
reinforces the need to explore laryngeal NMJ structure and
function and their response to aging and neuromuscular diseases to obtain an understanding at the molecular level of
how aging disrupts NMJ organization and stability. Future
studies will evaluate how aging alters the molecular mechanisms that initiate and sustain NMJ assembly in the intrinsic
laryngeal muscles.
