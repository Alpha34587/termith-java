Abstract
We recently demonstrated that retinal ganglion cell function, optic nerve head parameters and the retinal nerve ﬁber layer thickness are
not altered in early dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Our current objective was to assess whether the function of cells located more
distally in the retina is also unaffected by the disease. We evaluated 23 individuals with early to moderate DAT and 23 healthy age-matched
subjects, all displaying clinically normal visual function. Scotopic and photopic ﬂash electroretinograms (fERGs) and oscillatory potentials
(OPs) were recorded. The amplitude and latency of the retinal potentials did not differ between DAT and control subjects. Our current results
showing normal fERGs and OPs in early DAT indicate that the underlying neurons giving rise to these signals are not impaired by the
disease process. These data support and extend our recent ﬁndings suggesting that visual deﬁcits in DAT do not stem from neuroretinal
dysfunction. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)
may present visual symptoms early in the disease process in
the absence of ocular disease and despite normal visual
acuity [19]. Visual symptomatology in Alzheimer’s disease
has largely been attributed to cellular loss and atrophy in
higher cortical areas [21]. Over the last ﬁfteen years however, several histological studies [3,8,18] have reported a
loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve degeneration in DAT, suggesting that visual symptoms may
have a retinal/optic nerve origin. Contradictory results have
also been published however [4,5]. The controversial nature
of these results, together with the difﬁculty obtaining accurate histological measurements, have prompted clinical investigations to determine whether retinal function is altered

in DAT. Some have suggested that there are [9,22] or not
[16] deﬁcits in the RGCs or neurons located more distally
within the retina. Others have shown that the retinal nerve
ﬁber layer (RNFL) comprising the axons of the RGCs
converging in the optic nerve head (ONH) is altered in DAT
[7].
In an attempt to reconcile discrepancies among published
ﬁndings and to better understand visual function in DAT,
we recently conducted a series of investigations on various
anatomical and neurophysiological indicators of visual
function along the primary visual pathways in the early
stages of DAT. We have shown that DAT individuals do not
show alterations in: 1) the pattern-electroretinogram, an
electrical signal originating predominantly from the RGCs
[11], 2) the thickness of the RNFL [12], and 3) the topographical elements of the ONH, including the optic disc,
physiological cup and neuroretinal rim areas [10].
The present study was conducted to investigate whether
the photoreceptors, bipolar/Mueller cells, and amacrine interneurons of the retina are also unaffected in the milder

stages of DAT. To this effect, we recorded the fERG and its
oscillatory potentials (OPs) in DAT and healthy subjects.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects
Twenty-three individuals with mild to moderate DAT
(69.1 years Ϯ 1.4) and 23 healthy age-matched controls
(71.3 years Ϯ 1.4) were evaluated. All participants were
free of ocular disease and systemic disorders affecting vision.
The healthy controls were recruited through an university-based geriatric institute, while DAT individuals were
referred by neurologists and geriatricians working at this
institute or at two other academic hospitals. DAT individuals met the criteria for a diagnosis of probable DAT.
Diagnoses were provided by the referring specialists according to NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines [14] and DSM-IV
criteria [1] after the results of a medical history review, a
physical examination, laboratory and neuroimaging evaluations, and neuropsychological testing had been analyzed.
Dementia severity ranged from mild to moderate as determined by both Reisberg’s functional assessment staging
[15] and Berg’s CDR scale [2]. The group-averaged duration of the disease was 3 years, and the mean results for the
Mini Mental-State Examination were 22.05 Ϯ 1.02, ranging
from 14 to 29.
All subjects received a complete eye examination, including an ocular/medical personal/familial history review,
assessments of visual acuity (VA), refraction, ocular alignment, ocular motilities, pupillary reﬂexes and intraocular
pressure (IOP), as well as a dilated fundus examination,
biomicroscopy of the anterior and posterior segments and
24-2 SITA-fast Humphrey visual ﬁeld testing. The perimetric results for all controls were within normal limits, as were
those of most DAT individuals. Visual ﬁeld testing could
not be reliably evaluated in a few DAT subjects due to their
inability to comply with the procedural instructions, but
none showed indicators of ocular pathology or abnormalities in the other clinical tests of vision. All subjects had a
corrected VA of 20/40 (6/12) or better in the test eye and
IOP Ͻ 22 mmHg. Healthy subjects completed a medical
questionnaire to rule out psychiatric/neurological disorders,
systemic diseases, surgical procedures and/or medication
intake that may interfere with our ﬁndings. DAT individuals
were prescreened to that effect by their referring physician.
The controls further underwent a neuropsychometric evaluation to rule out memory/cognitive deﬁcits. All aspects of
the experimentation conformed to the ethical guidelines
established by committees at our institutions. Each subject
signed a consent form after the nature and purpose of the
study had been clearly explained.

2.2. Electrophysiological recordings
A DTL ﬁber electrode placed in the inferior conjunctival
cul de sac of the test eye was used to monocularly record the
fERG and OPs, with the other eye patched. An Ag/AgCl
electrode positioned close to the lateral canthus of the test
eye served as the reference, while a similar electrode placed
on the wrist was used for the ground. The skin was cleansed
with alcohol and rubbed with an abrasive cream prior to
applying these electrodes. The electrode impedance was
kept below 5 k⍀. The fERG a-wave, b-wave and OPs were
simultaneously recorded through dilated pupils (1% tropicamide) with a Nicolet Pathﬁnder averager. The electrical
responses were ampliﬁed and bandpass-ﬁltered (a-wave &amp;
b-wave: 1–1500 Hz; OPs: 50 –1500 Hz). An artifact reject
control was activated to eliminate signals unrelated to the
visual stimuli. All subjects were continuously monitored
during data acquisition, which consisted of 3 trials of an
average of 20, 100 msec epochs for each of the ﬂash
colors used. Blue (0.02 cd/m2/sec), white (1.90 cd/m2/
sec) and red (1.11 cd/m2/sec) ﬂashes (0.3 Hz) within a
Ganzfeld bowl were used for visual stimulation. Scotopic
fERGs in response to blue and then white light were
obtained following 30 minutes of dark adaptation. The
test eye was then light adapted for 5 minutes within the
Ganzfeld under a 99.5 cd/m2 background illumination,
and photopic fERGs were recorded with red ﬂash presentations on a 17.2 cd/m2 background adapting light.
Subjects were asked to ﬁxate a dim red light emitting
diode in the center of the Ganzfeld during visual stimulation. All lighting in the laboratory was turned off
throughout the recording sessions.
2.3. Analyses
The amplitude and latency of the fERG a-wave, b-wave
and OPs were measured for all subjects. The a-wave amplitude corresponded to the voltage difference between the
baseline of the wave and its trough, while its latency was
measured from stimulus presentation to the trough of the
signal. The amplitude of the b-wave and each OP represented the voltage difference between the peak of the wave
and its preceeding trough, while the latency was measured
from ﬂash presentation to the peak of the relevant waveform. The blue, white and red ﬂashes elicited 3, 5 and 4 OP
wavelets, respectively. Mean responses across the three
trials for each of the ﬂash colors were obtained for each
subject to provide representative values. Mean data for each
ﬂash color were then obtained across subjects within
groups. All data are expressed as group-averaged values ϩ
one standard error of the mean (SEM). An analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the fERG recordings obtained from DAT and control subjects for an alpha
level of p Ͻ 0.05.

of the signals were measured (see text for more details). The scale is presented for each waveform.

3. Results
Representative fERG a-wave, b-wave and OP waveforms obtained with our experimental set-up are presented
in Fig. 1. The group-averaged amplitudes for the a- and
b-waves elicited with blue, white and red ﬂashes are presented in Fig. 2A, while their latencies are shown in Fig. 2B.
As seen in these ﬁgures, the results did not differ between
DAT and healthy individuals for any of the ﬂash colors used
( p Ͼ 0.05). Fig. 2C and 2D present the group-averaged OP
amplitudes and latencies for the three ﬂash colors, respectively. These ﬁgures show that results did not differ between
DAT and control individuals for the blue, white and red
ﬂashes ( p Ͼ 0.05). Pupil size was measured at the end of
testing for each subject. Group-averaged data indicated that
there was no difference in dilated pupil diameters between
the two groups ( p Ͼ 0.05).
4. Discussion
Our results revealed that the amplitude and latency of the
scotopic and photopic fERG components are not affected in
mild DAT subjects. They indicate therefore that the neural
generators of the fERG a-wave, b-wave, and OPs, namely
the photoreceptors, bipolar/Mueller cells and amacrine interneurons of the retina, respectively, are not altered in early
DAT.

Our ﬁndings are in agreement with the results obtained in
the few other studies [9,16,20] that evaluated the fERG in
DAT. These reports showed that the scotopic and photopic
a- and b-waves are normal in DAT individuals, suggesting
that the outermost retinal layers are spared by the disease
process. Extending these ﬁndings, the results of the current
study demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the OPs are also
unaffected by the disorder.
Our fERG data further support and extend our earlier
investigations of visual function in DAT. We recently
showed that the amplitude and latency of the RGC-generated ERGs are normal in the early stages of the disease [11].
We also demonstrated that the thickness of the RNFL is
similar between DAT and healthy individuals [12]. These
latter data were obtained by laser polarimetry, a technique
that is based on the birefringent properties of the RNFL due
to the speciﬁc arrangement of the RGC microtubules [13].
Finally, we evaluated the ONH with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope, a technology that allows the scanning of the
ONH and the subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction
of the intraocular portion of the optic nerve [17]. Our results
indicated that the optic nerve disc, cup and rim areas do not
differ between DAT and control individuals [10].
Collectively, our current and previous ﬁndings provide
indirect evidence that the various layers of the retina and the
ONH parameters investigated are free of DAT induced
atrophy, at least in the early stages of the disease.
